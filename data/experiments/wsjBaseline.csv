After meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo during a two-day visit to the country, Mr. Li said China would consider raising this year’s import quota for Indonesian palm oil by at least 500,000 tons, in what would be the second consecutive annual increase. China, the largest buyer of Indonesian palm oil behind India and the European Union, imported 3.7 million tons of the product last year. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil, exporting a record of around 30 million tons of crude palm oil and its derivatives in 2017. Production of palm oil, the world’s most widely used vegetable oil, and derivatives that go into making detergents, cosmetics and biofuel, is one of Indonesia’s most important industries, employing millions and bringing in billions of dollars in foreign currency through exports. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said China needed more palm oil partly because it is developing a biofuel blend of 5% palm oil and diesel. Indonesia and neighboring Malaysia are currently in a trade spat with the European Union, which is seeking to ban the import of palm oil used for biofuel by 2021, largely due to concerns that the development of plantations is contributing to global deforestation. Indonesia and Malaysia account for more than 85% of global palm-oil supply and both have criticized the EU ban as protectionist and designed to safeguard markets for European farmers. The new quota from China will help reduce Indonesia’s dependency on European markets, said Danang Girindrawardana, executive director of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association. Beijing and Jakarta have been expanding ties under Mr. Widodo, with Chinese tourists becoming the top visitors to the Southeast Asian nation and foreign investment rising to record levels. China was Indonesia’s third-largest foreign investor in 2017, with much of the investment going into smelters to refine minerals for export. China is also seeking to build Southeast Asia’s first high-speed railway on Indonesia’s main island of Java, a multibillion-dollar project that so far has been hung up by land-acquisition problems and other issues. Indonesia is seeking to improve its trade balance. Officials said Monday that the economy, the largest in Southeast Asia, expanded 5.06% in the first quarter of 2018, below economists’ expectations, in part because import growth continued to outpace exports."

ATHN 20.53% for $160 a share. Elliott said the offer is a 27% premium to Athenahealth’s Friday closing price. Shares in Athenahealth rose 24% in Monday morning trading to $155.75 following the announcement. Elliott, which disclosed an 8.9% stake in Athenahealth including derivatives, said in a letter to the company’s board that it “may also be able to substantially improve the proposed price with additional, private diligence.” “It is clear to us and becoming clear to many others that Athenahealth’s potential will never be realized without the kind of operational change that the Company seems unable to deliver,” Elliott said. Elliott also said that last November, it approached the company about going private, but the company “refused to engage.” Athenahealth said in a statement its board will review the unsolicited proposal and “determine the course of action” it believes is best for the company and its shareholders. In recent months, Athenahealth has made several changes to its executive posts. Former General Electric Co. CEO Jeff Immelt became chairman of the company earlier this year, succeeding Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush in the role. Athenahealth said Mr. Bush would cede the chairmanship last year as part of a move backed by Elliott and another large investor. The company also hired Marc Levine, a former software company executive, to join the company earlier this year as its finance chief. One of Elliott’s complaints in its letter to Athenahealth’s board was that the company’s “leadership team has lacked stability” noting that the company has had a revolving door of CEOs and that its chief product officer also just left the firm. Elliott disclosed last year that it had a 9.2% stake in the company."

But the official— Jan Smets of Belgium—also suggested investors might be right to have recently pushed back their forecasts for when the ECB might increase interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. Speaking to The Wall Street Journal in Belgium’s capital, Mr. Smets, who sits on the ECB’s 25-member rate-setting committee as governor of the Belgian central bank, indicated that ECB officials remain confident in the economic outlook and are ready to discuss changing their policy mix. “The latest data remain pretty consistent with the story of the economic expansion continuing at a robust pace,” Mr. Smets said. He suggested the ECB soon will be ready to phase out its €30 billion-a-month ($35.9 billion) bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, and shift the focus of its communications toward possible interest-rate increases. “When you have built up a large stock of assets, it’s natural that the relative importance of these instruments will change,” he said. The bond purchases likely would be gradually reduced to zero after the latest extension of the program ends in September, rather than halted abruptly. “We want to be gradual; we want to avoid surprises or shocks,” he said. A run of recent data, from industrial production to retail sales, has indicated that the 19-nation currency union is cooling after outpacing the U.S. economy for two straight years. Mr. Smets nevertheless sounded bullish, largely attributing the slowdown to “a certain normalization” after recent strong growth and temporary factors such as strikes and cold weather. “On the basis of our assessment today, I would expect a move from asset purchases to greater importance of other elements,” such as guidance on the level of future interest rates, he said. “In the [ECB’s] June and July meetings, we will perhaps have a better understanding of the meaning of recent soft indicators.” Still, Mr. Smets seemed to acknowledge that the recent economic slowdown might delay the ECB from increasing its key interest rate, now at minus 0.4%. Investors until recently expected the ECB to raise rates as soon as this year, but recently pushed back their forecasts until later next year. “The fact that investors have pushed back their forecasts for interest rates is a reflection that markets understand very well that our policy is data dependent,” Mr. Smets said. “They understand well the way we are behaving and thinking.”"

The Taiwanese supplier, MediaTek Inc., 2454 -2.15% won approval to resume exports of chips to ZTE, a MediaTek spokesman said Monday. The company supplies chipsets used in a number of ZTE smartphones, and while not a cure-all, analysts say a resumption of sales to ZTE restores an important part of ZTE’s supply chain. U.S. companies last month were banned by the U.S. Commerce Department from exporting components to Shenzhen-based ZTE, a move that ZTE has said cuts it off from crucial parts and threatens its survival. While Taiwanese firms like MediaTek aren’t directly covered by the ban, Taiwanese regulators required companies there that do business with ZTE to apply for permits to continue exporting to ZTE. The MediaTek spokesman said Taiwanese authorities granted their approval on Friday. An official at Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic affairs, which grants export permits, confirmed that it granted an export permit to MediaTek. The official said several other Taiwanese firms are still awaiting export approval, but declined to name them. A ZTE spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment. MediaTek supplies chipsets for a number of ZTE smartphones sold world-wide. While ZTE could conceivably rely on MediaTek to replace chipsets made by others, it is unlikely to solve all its woes, said Edison Lee, a telecom analyst at Jefferies. For example, San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. makes some high-end chipsets that the Taiwanese firm can’t replace, he said. “MediaTek being able to supply chipsets to ZTE is a good thing, but it’s not good enough,” Mr. Lee said. In addition, Qualcomm is set to supply ZTE with 5G chipsets that ZTE needs for its phones to run on next-generation wireless networks, he said. ZTE relies on an array of U.S. companies for an array of crucial parts, including parts for its smartphones and components used in the gear it sells to telecom operators. ZTE is the fourth-largest smartphone vendor in the U.S. and uses the Android operating system—made by Alphabet Inc.’s Google—for its phones. ZTE has been fighting the U.S. export ban since it was announced last month. On Sunday, it said it formally submitted a request for a stay of the ban with the U.S. Commerce Department. Last week, Chinese officials raised concerns with the ban to a U.S. trade delegation traveling in China. —Yoko Kubota contributed to this article."

The new revelation comes about 2½ years after U.S. environmental authorities disclosed that Volkswagen had rigged millions of diesel engines to cheat on emissions test for nearly decade. The latest discovery, Audi said in a statement, was made during a routine inspection of engine software as the auto maker continues to hunt down and remove illegal code. Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment of former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn on charges of fraud and conspiracy. Mr. Winterkorn was CEO at the company from 2007 until September 2015, when he was forced to resign in the wake of the revelations about the diesel scandal. Audi CEO Rupert Stadler said recently that the “diesel crisis at Audi is not over yet,” as the new discovery of illegal software shows. Company officials say they only have combed through about 95% of the millions of lines of software code on dozens of engines and configurations. Audi discovered that there was code in the engine-control software of its outgoing A6 and A7 models that use 3-liter diesel engines that reduced the use of AdBlue urea solution to extend the supply of AdBlue until a scheduled check up. AdBlue is sprayed into the exhaust stream to break down nitrogen oxide into its basic components, rendering the toxic substance harmless. The illegal software isn’t on the new generation of Audi A6 and A7 vehicles, the company said. Of the 60,000 vehicles affected, half of them were sold in Germany; none was sold in the U.S. All Audi diesel vehicles sold in the U.S. were covered by the 2016 settlement. After discovering the software about a week ago, Audi said it stopped delivering the vehicles and informed Germany’s KBA motor-vehicle agency. Separately, the KBA said it would hold an official hearing with the company to investigate the issue. Audi said it would propose fixing the affected cars with a new software update. If approved by the KBA, Audi would recall all of the vehicles and update the software."

Phillips,Logistics Report,business,"Digital Freight, Freight Broker, Freight Forwarding, Freight Investment, Freight Marketplace, Freight Tech, Load-Matching, Shipping Technology, Third-Party Logistics, Trucking Startup","Established U.S. logistics firms say digital-friendly freight startups that are drawing growing interest in Silicon Valley still lack the scale and customer relationships to threaten their share of the market. Executives at C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., CHRW -0.13% the biggest broker of freight services in the U.S., said their large-scale shipper customers are looking for more than just good technology. “We continue to invest in technology, but the experience we have, the scale we have, we think that’s the competitive advantage for us,” Bob Biesterfeld, chief operating officer at C.H. Robinson, said in an interview. Venture capital investors are increasingly gambling on upstarts including Flexport Inc., Convoy, Haven Inc. and others, arming them with new funding to take aim at global freight brokers like C.H. Robinson, XPO Logistics Inc. XPO 3.02% and other top shipping-services firms. According to PitchBook Data Inc., venture capital firms invested nearly $1.2 billion in freight-related firms in 2017, up from $200 million five years ago. In their race to upend the shipping industry’s establishment, freight startup Convoy has attracted funding from such celebrity investors as Microsoft founder Bill Gates and members of the rock band U2. San Francisco-based Flexport, one of the biggest and most ambitious of the new ventures, last month announced a $100 million investment from Chinese courier company SF Express. The new funding adds to more than $200 million Flexport raised from investors as of last fall. It comes as the company is opening warehouses and offices around the world as it pushes a plan to become a top-10 player in the $400-billion global freight-forwarding market. C.H. Robinson executives say they haven’t been sitting back on their heels. The company says it is spending about $150 million a year on technology, and operates an internal “innovation lab” in which employees can test and vet ideas. The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based operator also holds “hack-a-thons” to brainstorm solutions to customer problems. “We’ll see press releases from these private-equity-backed startups with some new feature they’re promoting as being cutting-edge and revolutionary, and we look back at our tech and say, ‘We do that too. We’ve been doing that for a while,’” Mr. Biesterfeld said. The company jump-started its technology investment four years ago with its $365 million acquisition of Freightquote, an early entry in creating digital marketplaces for searching out trucking services. XPO Logistics Inc. said it would spend about $450 million this year on technology ranging from automation and robotics to data analysis and the company’s digital freight marketplace, which launched earlier this year and now has about 100 large customers and 2,500 carriers. “The world is going toward digital,” XPO Chief Executive Brad Jacobs said in an interview. Mr. Jacobs said freight services are moving toward “cloud-based digital marketplaces” that are “fully-automated, self-learning, dynamic.” —Jennifer Smith contributed to this story."

Boring, at least, if you aren’t interested in a company bringing in staggering amounts of revenue and growing at its fastest pace in a decade. Microsoft didn’t even offer the excitement of the latest new device or Windows upgrade at its annual Build soiree that kicked off Monday. Instead it is all about what lies under the hood; specifically, the tools and services built on a massive global network powered by artificial intelligence. And those are what the company is choosing to showcase this week. And for good reason. Like big tech peers Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft has invested billions in that network—and stands to invest billions more. But unlike those other two, Microsoft’s business outlook hinges almost completely on its ability to drive businesses and consumers to use the tools and services built on that network. Amazon, by contrast, still makes most of its money in online retail while Google is still predominantly an advertising company. Luckily for Microsoft, that vision no longer sounds far-fetched. The company is on track to break the $100 billion mark in annual revenue for the first time in its fiscal year ending in June. And based on the fiscal fourth-quarter projections given in the company’s earnings call last month, this year’s revenue will be up at least 13% from last year’s adjusted number, which included a $6 billion boost from deferred revenue related to Windows 10 sales. That will be Microsoft’s best year of growth in a decade—essentially since the smartphone revolution made the once powerful company seem not so powerful. Microsoft’s challenge is to maintain that growth. Wall Street is projecting double-digit sales gains for at least the next two years. And the stock—which has nearly tripled in value since Satya Nadella took the CEO reins in early 2014—is now at 24 times forward earnings, which is its highest multiple in more than a decade. Microsoft can make that bet pay off, but it will be anything but boring."

Quest analyzed more than 10 million urine tests conducted on behalf of employers. “It’s striking as we look at all this data and see continuing increases in the use of illicit drugs. That’s a concern for everyone,” said Barry Sample, Quest’s senior director for science and technology. The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 ushered in an era of job-related drug-testing, prompting a rapid decrease in positive tests. Since the mid-2000s, the positivity rate has hovered close to 4%, although it hit a 30-year-low of 3.5% in 2012, Quest said. Positive tests for opiates, such as morphine and oxycodone, dropped sharply by 17% in 2017 from the year before, likely reflecting continuing crackdowns on illegal or excessive opioid prescriptions, Mr. Sample said. Positive tests for marijuana rose in states that have recently legalized the drug for medical or recreational use. In Nevada, where voters legalized marijuana use starting in January 2017, positives were up 43% last year. Quest data suggested a continuing surge in methamphetamine use in the Midwest, South and parts of the Northeast. Some states, including Nebraska and Idaho, saw sharp increases in cocaine positives. The Quest data combines results for the general workforce along with tests of workers in safety-sensitive jobs, such as pilots, bus drivers and nuclear power plant operators, who are subject to federally mandated testing, including random checks. In the general workforce, 5% of tests came back positive for an illicit substance, up from 4.9% in 2016. Of people in safety-sensitive roles, 2.1% tested positive in 2017, up from 2% the prior year. In all, 2.6% of workers Quest tested in the general workforce showed positive results for marijuana, although the company said fewer customers are requesting the marijuana test. While marijuana is still an illicit substance at the federal level, 30 states and the District of Columbia have adopted laws making it legal in some form, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Even in states that have loosened or dropped restrictions on buying, selling and using marijuana, the legal status of the drug is unstable, said Danielle Urban, a partner in the Denver office of law firm Fisher Phillips LLP. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January rescinded a memo from President Barack Obama’s administration that directed prosecutors to make marijuana enforcement a low priority. Employers in most states still have a right—and a fair amount of discretion—to maintain a drug-free workplace. But as the legal landscape rapidly shifts and qualified workers become harder to find, some employers are questioning the wisdom of rejecting employees because they may have smoked pot. “Does the fact that someone smokes marijuana recreationally make them a bad employee? No,” said Tracie Sponenberg, senior vice president of human resources at the Granite Group, a wholesaler of plumbing, heating and other supplies in New Hampshire, where marijuana is still illegal. The company employs many drivers, who are required by federal law to undergo regular drug testing and it only tests workers who are in those safety-sensitive roles, said Ms. Sponenberg, who also sits on the special-expertise committee of the Society for Human Resource Management. She said a prior employer of hers had a policy of randomly testing a sample of workers at a warehouse that stored pharmaceutical products. A few years ago, a handful of employees who were tested in one batch received marijuana positives. The company decided not to fire any of them. “We would have severely depleted our staff,” she said. Instead, the workers were offered a chance to take the test a second time."

Baime,Cars,lifestyle,"250 Gte, Classic Cars, Collector’s Car, Family Heirloom, Ferrari, G.m., Prancing Horse, Race Car, Sports Car, The Wrong Arm Of The Law","Bob Boniface, 52, director of exterior design at General Motors’ Buick division, from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., on his 1962 Ferrari 250 GTE, as told to A.J. Baime. My father, Raymond, was a physician, and when I was growing up, he owned some Ferraris. In 1973, he bought the one pictured here for $3,800 to use as his daily driver. These were not expensive cars at the time. We knew from the registration card that this Ferrari’s original owner had been British actor Peter Sellers. We later learned that the vehicle had been delivered to Mr. Sellers while he was on the set of the 1963 movie “The Wrong Arm of the Law.” The car appears in that movie. (It was white at the time.) The 250 GTE was the first four-seat Ferrari ever produced in any volume. Enzo Ferrari launched his car company in the late 1940s and he sold a small number of street cars to wealthy clientele to fund his racing program. By the 1960s, he had become the most successful race-car builder in the world. Our 250 GTE was a window into Enzo Ferrari’s work during his heyday. In 1975, my father sold the car for $4,800. He had owned it for two years and made a thousand dollars. He laughed all the way to the bank. Four years ago, my father found the original owners’ manual in his library. It had the registration card with Peter Sellers’s signature on it. He called me and said, “You’re connected in the car world. You should find that old Ferrari so we can give the owner this manual, as it is an important piece of history.” I looked for the car for three years. Last year, I posted a message on a Ferrari website and I received a private message back saying, “I bought the car from your father over 40 years ago and I still have it. I restored it. I am thinking of selling, if you’re interested.” The guy remembered meeting me when I was a boy. We struck a deal. It was not cheap, but the owner wanted the car to go to someone who appreciated its history, so he sold it for under market value. In April 2017, I got the car to my house. My father, now 93, came over. I said, “The last time we were in this car together, you drove. Now it’s my turn.” We went for a drive. He was over the moon, and so was I. —Contact A.J.

The story unfolds at a measured pace in France, during World War I, on a family farm where women are the guardians of the land and its traditions, while men are being slaughtered in insane, incessant conflict. (A few soldiers come back briefly on leave.) What these women..."

Galston,Columnists,domestic politics,"Political, General News, International Relations, Politics, Domestic Politics, Government Bodies, Executive Branch, Commentaries, Opinions","President Trump, it seems, knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Earlier this year he claimed that the U.S. gets “practically nothing” from the $1.2 billion it spends annually to keep 28,500 troops in South Korea. He forgets, or perhaps he never knew, that the U.S. waged an expensive and bloody struggle to restore the status quo ante after Kim Il Sung’s invasion of the south. American troops in South Korea have maintained peace and stability ever since—65 years and counting. Compared with the costs of war, it’s a bargain. Mr...."

And the rising dollar has coincided with rising popularity for President Donald Trump. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that Mr. Trump is becoming less unpopular, but however one chooses to describe the economic and political trends, they are certain to encourage Mr. Trump’s congressional allies seeking re-election this fall. In mid-December, shortly before the enactment of the Trump tax cuts, the average of public opinion surveys tracked by..."

Riley,Opinion,domestic politics,"Ben Carson, Affordable Housing, Political, General News, Society, Community, Politics, International Relations, Domestic Politics, Social Issues","The rationale for Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty” was that the government should take a more active role in helping people get on their feet. Today the federal government is more active than ever in this regard, but whether its efforts are truly helping is debatable. Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon who now runs the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, understands that often the best way for the government to help the poor is by getting out of their way. In an interview Monday, Mr. Carson explained to..."

Martin Peretz reviews “Rooted Cosmopolitans” by James Loeffler.",Martin Peretz,Books,US,"Book Review, Recommended Books, Books, Political, General News, Society, Community, Arts, Entertainment, Politics","For some 70 years, the words “human rights” have been talismanic—a shorthand for the elusive modern dream, that of universal recognition of the rights of persons and minorities, rights that precede and transcend politics. But like most talismans, its real meaning is obscured by constant use: “Human rights” has also become a collection of attitudes and sociological signifiers, a vague term to be dismissed by realists and swooned over by idealists. James Loeffler’s book “Rooted Cosmopolitans” is a bracing and nuanced attempt to correct this—to restore a grave, complex, powerful idea by tracing it to the people, most of..."
