The residents of Ghazni, a provincial capital of 280,000 people about 110 miles south of the capital, Kabul, on a main highway, can hardly tell anymore whoís in charge, and fear has become an everyday companion. With the Taliban controlling some of the road network around Ghazni, citizens have long felt vulnerable. But during a recent visit, I kept hearing an even greater sense of defenselessness. Many here fear a full-on effort by the Taliban to seize the city could come at any time. Not content to merely control access to the city of 280,000, the insurgents have begun attacking police posts within it. The Taliban methodically extort money ó they say it is taxation ó from businesses in the city center, including those near the government headquarters, and an increasing number of insurgents live openly in the city. Their fighters regularly kill officials, security personnel and even traffic police officers. A Taliban court claims jurisdiction over the city and its outskirts, and carries out floggings, and even, sometimes, stonings. I have been to several Afghan provinces influenced by the Taliban, including Kunduz Province and its provincial capital before it fell to the insurgents. In those cities, the outskirts would seem dodgy but there was always some sense of reassurance of government control upon entering the city center. Ghazni, just a two-hour drive from Kabul, felt edgier. Many residents and even officials wondered out loud what the idea of a cityís collapse even meant anymore, and whether they were not living it already. The city is not far from Khost, where 14 people were killed Sunday in a bombing as they lined up to register to vote. Just getting to Ghazni can be a challenge. Highway 1, the road that connects Kabul to the south of Afghanistan, has always been dangerous. When American military convoys were common here, it was a frequent target for roadside bombs. Now, with the Americans mostly gone, its defense rests with Afghan troops, and the Taliban have grown bolder, often setting up surprise checkpoints not far from government outposts. As a precaution, on a recent trip, in case we ran into an insurgent checkpoint, I left in Kabul my reporterís badge and my smartphone, which had government and foreign contacts in it. The road is safe to travel only during daylight, preferably 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., when soldiers patrol. On my drive back to Kabul, I took the SIM card out of my simpler cellphone ó on which I had received several calls from the office during our trip ó and held it in my fingers, ready to throw it away if we sensed danger. One of my first interviews in the area was with the family of a traffic police officer, Ali Ahmad Jalali, who was killed on April 20, shot eight times. Their village, Tauhidabad, is about six miles from the center of Ghazni, down a bumpy dirt road. His cousin, Ishaq Bahrami, quickly ushered me, for tea and conversation, to premises where he had a property dealership. Mr. Jalali, who had three children, had been a regular police officer, but had shifted to the traffic force. That was no protection. He was shot around 10 a.m. when leaving his wifeís familyís house. ìWhere he was shot was not 100 meters away from the Afghan Army check post,î Mr. Bahrami said. Mr. Bahrami said he paid about $40 to the Taliban last year, but had not yet been approached for a further payment this year. The authorities in Ghazni Province say the killings of security force personnel are usually carried out by young men on motorcycles, often using pistols with silencers. While about 50 government employees were killed in the city last year, the count for one 30-day stretch in March and April alone this year stands at 10 dead. Mohammad Arif Noori, the spokesman for the provincial governor, said that on May 1, an Afghan soldier had been shot and killed at midday in the Hada-e-Qandar neighborhood of Ghazni. To get a better sense of the security, I drove with a senior police official into the heart of the city. The commander, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to brief the news media, climbed a hill with me to survey the area. ìThe Taliban are present in the city,î he said, pointing out a particular neighborhood where they were most prevalent. ìThey have their homes here and can do whatever they want to.î ìMost of them have guns in their homes,î he continued ìand we canít do anything because we do not have the ability. Even if we arrest them, they will be out of jail soon and will come after the police to seek revenge.î The commander bluntly acknowledged that his men were outnumbered. For that Taliban-heavy area, he had four police officers, he said; a maximum of three would be on duty at any one time. He suggested that they had reached an accommodation with the insurgents there to keep his men from being targeted. He did not specify the nature of the arrangement because of the sensitivity involved. Across the city of Ghazni, store owners and other businesspeople said they had no choice but to pay the Taliban representatives who say they are imposing taxes. The insurgents come once a year and take the money they gather to Mongur, an area outside the city, officials said. A private radio and television station, next to a police station, had to pay about $1,700, employees said. A small shop on a main road not far from the governorís office paid a little less than $200, its owner, Hajji Fateh, revealed. ìThe agent came and took the money,î Mr. Fateh said. ìHe said, ëIf you donít pay, I will put this pistol to your head.í So how can I not pay?î The governor of Ghazni, Abdul Karim Matin, acknowledged the practice. ìThe Taliban collect money from the people, unfortunately, be it shopkeepers or anyone, in the name of tax,î he said. ìThis is extortion, not tax.î Before the interview, Mr. Matin was busy with security meetings, uniformed men going in and out of his office. When he moves from one building to another inside the governorís compound, he drives in an armored S.U.V., sometimes escorted by security forces in Humvees. Things got particularly bad at the end of April, when the central government in Kabul expressed fear that the Taliban had made it a priority to overrun Ghazni. A late-night call from the authorities in the capital to the regional army commander sent forces rushing to the city. The attacks turned out to be less severe than expected, although at least four police officers were killed in an outpost in the Khasheek neighborhood of the city. The army has been keeping more troops than usual in Ghazni, and an outright Taliban takeover has seemed unlikely. On Sunday, though, Mr. Bahrami said by telephone that fierce fighting was underway in Ghazni and that all the police checkpoints in the Khasheek neighborhood had fallen to the Taliban. At the end of my trip to Ghazni, as we drove back to Kabul, my heart beat faster until we entered the relative safety of the capital city. I thought about the shrinking government control in the province I had just left. When the Taliban infiltrate at will, shoot officials in broad daylight, and run a vast tax-collection system up to the gates of the governorís compound, how strong can the central governmentís authority be, even in its own backyard? I recalled one resident of Ghazni, Mohammad Anwar, 60, who said his son, Mujtaba, a 22-year-old policeman, was gunned down on the street by a Taliban assassin this year. He despaired about how frequent open killings were becoming in the city. ìThe government is very careless about the ordinary people of Ghazni,î he said. ìLosing a child is so painful,î he added, beginning to weep. ìYou endure a lot of hardship to raise a son, and then someone simply takes him from you.î"

The men were sitting in a palm-thatched hut perched on stilts on the edge of a branch of the Orinoco River. It had been two years since Mr. Peque√±o, a nurse, had visited this poor indigenous village in the remote Orinoco Delta region of eastern Venezuela. His notebook contained a registry of patients who had been part of an H.I.V. treatment program that, like the rest of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public health system, had fallen apart. Mr. Peque√±o took a roll call of the infected. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Armando Beria, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, reading from the top of the list. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Still here, ‚<U+0080>ù replied the headman, Ram√≥n Quint√≠n. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ebelio Quinino, ‚<U+0080>ù the nurse continued. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Still here.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mario Navarro.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dead.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Wilmer Medina.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dead.‚<U+0080>ù Of the 15 villagers who had been part of the treatment program, five had died of AIDS, the disease caused by H.I.V. In all, more than 40 residents of this village had died of AIDS or AIDS-like symptoms in the past several years ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in a settlement of only about 200. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m very worried, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Peque√±o said quietly. He looked stunned. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wiping out this community.‚<U+0080>ù In recent years, amid profound shortages of medicine coupled with widespread ignorance, H.I.V. has spread rapidly throughout the Orinoco Delta and is believed to have killed hundreds of the Warao indigenous people who live in settlements like Jobure de Guayo along the serpentine channels winding through this swampy, forested landscape. Even under the best of circumstances, it might be difficult to control the disease‚<U+0080><U+0099>s spread in such an isolated and deprived area. But the government has ignored the issue, medical specialists and Warao community leaders say, leaving the population to face a profound existential threat alone. Already, deaths and the flight of survivors have gutted at least one village. Dr. Jacobus de Waard, an expert in infectious diseases at the Central University of Venezuela, who has worked and traveled among the Warao for years, said that nothing less than the future of the ancient culture was at stake. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no intervention, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to affect the existence of the Warao, ‚<U+0080>ù he warned. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A part of the population is going to disappear.‚<U+0080>ù The epidemic plaguing the Warao is a crisis within a crisis, a dramatic example of how Venezuela is failing to grapple with a resurgent AIDS emergency even as the annual number of new H.I.V. infections and AIDS-related deaths around the world continues to decline. Under President Hugo Ch√°vez, Venezuela‚<U+0080><U+0099>s H.I.V./AIDS prevention and treatment program was world class and the country seemed to have the disease under control. Advertisement But during the presidency of Nicol√°s Maduro, which began in 2013, Venezuela‚<U+0080><U+0099>s economy has crumbled, causing crippling shortages of medicine and diagnostic tests, and compelling many of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s best doctors to emigrate. The government has even stopped distributing free condoms, which can help prevent the spread of H.I.V., activists say. The price for a pack can cost the equivalent of several days of minimum wage. The government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inaction, the activists say, is especially egregious considering that President Maduro ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like his predecessor ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has cast himself as a champion of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indigenous people. The Maduro administration did not respond to requests for interviews with officials of the national H.I.V. prevention program, the health ministry and the ministry of indigenous affairs. The government has released health statistics only sporadically in recent years, and doctors often dispute their accuracy. But AIDS activists and specialists say that H.I.V. infection rates and the number of AIDS-related deaths have skyrocketed. So, too, has the number of once-stable H.I.V. patients whose health has collapsed for lack of a regular supply of antiretroviral drugs and medicines to treat opportunistic diseases. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a humanitarian emergency ‚<U+0080><U+0094> we have to be very emphatic, ‚<U+0080>ù insisted Jhonatan Rodr√≠guez, president of StopVIH, a Venezuelan activist group. Among the most disadvantaged Venezuelans, he said, are the Warao. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a population that has been totally neglected.‚<U+0080>ù The Warao, Venezuela‚<U+0080><U+0099>s second-largest indigenous group, have made their home for many centuries in the soggy delta region where the muddy waters of the Orinoco River fan out into distributaries that merge with the Atlantic Ocean. Advertisement Numbering about 30,000, they now live in hundreds of impoverished settlements in open-sided stilt homes perched at the edge of the region‚<U+0080><U+0099>s streams and rivers. The area is hard to reach. There are no roads, so travel is restricted to boats, mostly dugout canoes. There are no telephone landlines, and nearly the entire region is without cellphone signal. Only the largest villages have electricity, though usually only at night ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the generators that provide it often run out of fuel or break down. It can take several hours traveling by high-speed powerboat to reach the settlements from the state capital, Tucupita, but a fuel mafia now controls the distribution of gasoline in the region, driving costs beyond the reach of nearly every resident. River pirates make access to the delta even more difficult. H.I.V. was first detected among the Warao in 2007 and is thought to have been introduced by a returning migrant, one of many young Warao who have sought work in far-off Venezuelan cities as house cleaners, security guards, laborers, street vendors and prostitutes. A study published in 2013 warned of a burgeoning epidemic. It found that nearly 10 percent of Warao adults living in eight villages in the lower delta region tested positive for H.I.V. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a dramatic high prevalence, ‚<U+0080>ù the researchers wrote. In one community, about 35 percent of those tested were H.I.V. positive. By comparison, H.I.V. prevalence among the adult population in South and Central America was 0.5 percent. Worsening matters, the type of virus that had entered the population was particularly aggressive, with the potential to generate AIDS more quickly than other strains ‚<U+0080><U+0094> within several years of infection. The epidemic, the researchers warned, could be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating‚<U+0080>ù for the Warao. The disease was also spreading in an information vacuum among the Warao.

Villalba, a Venezuelan who led the investigation and is now a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. Advertisement He also ran up against government intransigence. As officials became aware of his alarming discoveries, he said, some tried to intimidate him and impede his work. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to show that the politics were failing, ‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Villalba said, referring to the Maduro government. Since then, the absence of prevention programs and severe language barriers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> many Warao are illiterate and do not speak fluent Spanish ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have allowed ignorance about the disease to flourish. Msgr. Ernesto Jos√© Romero, the apostolic vicar of Tucupita, said he has repeatedly spoken with the state governor and other officials about the crisis, to little effect. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have a government that wants to silence everything, ‚<U+0080>ù Monsignor Romero said in an interview in San Francisco de Guayo, a town in the lower delta region. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They say it will be resolved. But more and more people die.‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Villalba estimates that more than 80 percent of the Warao he diagnosed between 2010 and 2012 are now dead. Mr. Peque√±o, the nurse, knew all of those victims. They were his friends, neighbors and relatives. Many were also his patients. Born and raised in San Francisco de Guayo, Mr. Peque√±o has worked for 15 years at a small medical clinic there. He has also served as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s point person in the lower delta region for the distribution of antiretroviral medicine. Not that there has been much to hand out. From time to time, he said, officials in Tucupita send boxes of medicine downriver, sometimes with visiting medical students from the Central University of Venezuela. But it is never enough to ensure a steady supply for all the H.I.V.-positive patients in the area, he said, and most of the time he has none to give. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m like a soldier without a weapon, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Peque√±o, 34, lamented. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything.‚<U+0080>ù Stranded in San Francisco de Guayo for most of the past couple of years, Mr. Peque√±o lost touch with many of the H.I.V. patients in villages that he had been monitoring. But on a recent morning, he hitched a ride with me to go check in on some of them. Approaching Jobure de Guayo and clutching his notebook with the patient registry, Mr. Peque√±o pointed the boat toward the compound of Mr. Quint√≠n, the headman. As the boat puttered along the waterfront, people warmly hailed the nurse from their homes. Mr. Peque√±o took a seat on the floor of the Quint√≠n family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s communal kitchen, an open-sided platform made from hand-hewn wood planks and protected by a palm-thatched roof. The air sung with sounds of a preindustrial society. The crackle of a wood fire. A guacamaya‚<U+0080><U+0099>s squawk. The swish of an oar pulling through the water. The knock of a machete against raw taro. No family in Jobure de Guayo had been hit as hard by the epidemic as the headman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s extended clan, which had lost at least 12 people to AIDS or AIDS-like symptoms in the last two years. Men, women and children died in their palm-fiber hammocks, slung in six houses clustered around the communal kitchen. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is no medicine in the hospital. Why?‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Quint√≠n asked. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the past, if you were sick, they did everything possible to hospitalize you. Now, no, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My people are dying.‚<U+0080>ù Armando Beria, 25, a resident of Jobure de Guayo, was on Mr. Peque√±o‚<U+0080><U+0099>s patient list. He said he first heard about AIDS when a doctor visited the settlement in 2013 and tested people for the virus. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I did the examination and he said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You have it, too, ‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Beria recalled. He believes he may have contracted it through having sex with other men when he was younger ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a common practice among young Warao, especially before they are married. Researchers believe that men having sex with men was an important means of early dissemination of H.I.V. among the Warao. But the virus is now rampant in the broader population, and heterosexual sex and breast milk now appear to be other common forms of transmission. Advertisement Mr. Beria has dealt with recurring bouts of diarrhea, headaches and muscle pain, and has begun to lose weight, though he continues to have enough energy to fish and harvest taro for his wife and four young children. His wife has twice tested negative for H.I.V., most recently a year ago. But telltale lesions have started to appear on her body. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think she has it now, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, though he is powerless to know for sure in the absence of tests. Medication adherence among the Warao ‚<U+0080><U+0094> when there is medication available ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is poor, Mr. Peque√±o said. Patients abandon their medicine because it makes them feel nauseous, or because they start to feel better. And in the absence of antiretroviral drugs, many Warao have sought solutions in traditional medicine, turning to a key figure in Warao society, the wisidatu, a kind of shamanic healer. The sickness, many Warao believe, is the result of witchcraft Some in Mr. Quint√≠n‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family say they have fallen victim to a curse inflicted on them by a former village resident whom others accuse of being a hoarotu, a darker kind of shaman. Mikaela Perez, 33, a granddaughter of Mr. Quint√≠n, said the conflict originated in a dispute between her father and another villager. She said the villager put a hex on her father, whose death from AIDS-like symptoms was followed by a rash of others in the family. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A family that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s coming to an end, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Perez said, her expression plain. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Before we all lived together very happily. But now it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s coming to an end.‚<U+0080>ù Isayen Herrera contributed reporting"

Through it all, Franceís most militant unions have resisted. His changes, which set out to reshape the way Franceís economy and society work, are facing increasingly strong criticism from labor groups. For weeks, unions have staged a series of strikes to oppose efforts to make the nationís main railway system, the SNCF, more competitive. And in a symbol of a widening divide between workers and companies and the French state, unions representing Air France-KLM staff on Monday called for new strikes after rejecting a pay proposal. While Mr. Macronís economic changes do not take aim at the nationís flagship air carrier, weeks of parallel strikes at Air France and SNCF are emerging as a test of his ability to stick with pledges to enhance Franceís economic competitiveness and global leadership, which helped usher him to an electoral victory last May. The call for strikes at Air France has prompted the abrupt resignation of the airlineís chief executive and, in particular, ignited a conflict with the French government, which warned labor leaders that they risked driving Air France to the brink of calamity. The standoff, which has already cost the airline an estimated 300 million euros, or $360 million, in lost revenue, helped drive the companyís share price 13 percent lower on Monday. Franceís finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the company might ìdisappearî if unions persisted in their demands for an immediate 5 percent wage increase and continued rolling strikes that have already affected tens of thousands of fliers worldwide. The French government, which owns a minority stake in Air France, would not ride to the rescue with a taxpayer bailout if the airline faltered, Mr. Le Maire said. ìI am not taking the money of the French and putting it in a company that isnít at the required competitive level,î he said. The battle highlights efforts by Mr. Macron to remake Franceís economy. He has rammed a series of controversial changes to Franceís notoriously rigid labor laws through a Parliament stacked with members of his En Marche party, starting with a measure this year to make it easier for private companies to fire workers. Mr. Macron is also tilting at the unemployment and pension systems with controversial changes to reduce costs. In the midst of his drive, he is also challenging Franceís most time-tested institutions head-on. In March, he began negotiations for an overhaul of the heavily subsidized, debt-laden French rail system, targeting jobs-for-life schemes and benefits that are among the most generous of any profession in France in a bid to open the system to competition by 2020. Mr. Macronís moves have been cheered by businesses and investors, and have drawn companies including Facebook and Amazon to step up a presence in France. But they have also sparked fear and anger among swaths of French society. Many workers worry that the financing of the countryís cherished safety net will be plucked away and transferred to business, for the profit of shareholders. Even some analysts warn that the government may be going too far, by shifting the balance of power toward employers and greatly eroding the power of unions. The unions have been spoiling for a fight. In many ways, that has been Mr. Macronís point. Although only around 8 percent of the nationís workers are unionized, organized labor has long held outsize clout at the negotiating table with employers. In France, even small changes tend to agitate unions, which have historically sought to secure workplace protections through protests and strikes. Before pushing through changes to the labor laws, Mr. Macron held more than 50 meetings with unions shortly after his election in an effort to get them onboard with his program. The General Confederation of Labor, known as the C.G.T., has largely resisted, seeing an effort to repeal hard-won labor rights. The union has been at the forefront of mobilizing actions that in recent weeks have led hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, and encouraged regular strikes at the nationís railway system that are scheduled to last until July. The more moderate French Democratic Confederation of Labor, Franceís largest union after recently overtaking the C.G.T. in membership, has pushed for a more flexible approach as the forces of globalization change the competitive landscape. At Air France, the government pushed back against labor groups over the weekend after the chief executive, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned abruptly on Friday. Mr. Janaillac had failed to win workers over in a contentious internal referendum that proposed a 7 percent pay increase for pilots and staff over four years. Air Franceís hard-line pilotsí union had demanded an immediate 5 percent raise to make up for wages that have been frozen for nearly five years. The company has recorded record profits thanks to lower oil prices since 2016, prompting the union to insist that Air France could afford the pay increase. The clash was at least a far cry from a standoff between employees and managers in 2015, when a mob of angry workers stormed a meeting on job cuts and ripped the shirts off two top executives, who escaped over a chain-link fence for safety. Still, it has set up a dangerous game of brinkmanship between unions and the French government, which has hinted that it is willing to let Air France go under. ìIf it doesnít make the necessary efforts to be at the same competitive level of Lufthansa and other major airlines, it will disappear,î Mr. Le Maire said on the French television station BFM on Sunday. He added that the unionís salary demands were ìunjustifiedî and urged employees to show ìresponsibility.î Such talk is reminiscent of Mr. Macronís overall approach to overhauling the economy. Some analysts have criticized the way he has pushed through changes to the labor laws, most of which have been done by the equivalent of executive order, raising questions about how democratic ó or not ó his methods have been. One year into his presidency, Mr. Macron is routinely referred to in the French media as Jupiter or Napoleon Bonaparte, when he is not being compared to French kings. This weekend, thousands of demonstrators amassed in Paris to express anger at what they called a ìsoft dictatorship,î while brandishing a portrait of King Louis XVI with Mr. Macronís face Photoshopped in. ìEmmanuel Macron is walking a fine line between the rehabilitation of a certain presidential authority and authoritarianism,î Jean-Claude Monod, a specialist in political philosophy, said in an interview published Monday in the French daily Le Monde. ìOne has the impression of a deafness in front of forms of protest or political experimentations, of a will to use force for his reforms.î"

Until this past weekend, Brad Marchand of the Boston Bruins had apparently managed to get away with licking. Marchand, the Bruins left wing, got into a tussle with Tampa Bay Lightning right wing Ryan Callahan on Friday ó and videos appear to show him running his tongue along Callahanís face. ìWell, he punched me four times in the face, so, you know, he just kept getting close,î Marchand said of Callahan and the episode, according to ESPN. Marchand is described in his official team biography as ìantagonisticî and ìirritatingî and is nicknamed Little Ball of Hate. He is among the leagueís most penalized players and has been repeatedly suspended or fined throughout his career. So perhaps it should not be shocking to learn that Marchand has done this before. Once again, video from last month appears to show Marchand nibbling at the cheek and neck of Toronto Maple Leafs center Leo Komarov. (The move marked something of an escalation for Marchand, who apparently tried to kiss Komarov on the cheek during a game last year. For a full history of Marchandís antics, USA Today has created this helpful guide.) Anyway, the N.H.L. had finally had enough. On Saturday, the league said in a tweet that it had put Marchand on notice that his actions were ìunacceptable and similar behavior in the future will be dealt with by way of supplemental discipline.î The news was likely welcomed by Callahan, who had expressed displeasure about the episode after the game. ìI donít know what the difference is between spitting in someoneís face and licking it,î Callahan said. Having seen that the league had weighed in, Marchandís coach, Bruce Cassidy, said on Sunday that he had instructed his player to ìzip it,î ESPN reported. Cassidy also said he understood that Marchandís moves were an attempt to get under his opponentís skin. Nonetheless, he said he had urged him to find another way. Marchand led the Bruins in points during the regular season, and his coach suggested he might more effectively annoy opponents by ìscoring some goals.î Athletes, though, have long invented creative ways to rattle their opponents. The former N.B.A. center Dikembe Mutombo was known to wag his finger at an opposing player after blocking his shot. Lance Stephenson famously blew in LeBron Jamesís ear during the 2014 Eastern Conference Finals. And although it was perhaps more of a method he used while concentrating than taunting, Michael Jordan periodically stuck his tongue out, especially when he was about to do something acrobatic. Marchand, it turns out, will have the entire off-season to mull a new tactic. He and the Bruins fell to the Lightning, 3-1, on Sunday and were eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Associated Press reported there were no licking episodes during the game."

Californiaís economy has soared into the stratosphere, but not without inflicting some pain. Paralyzing traffic is one symptom; the increasingly absurd price of putting a roof over oneís head is another. One person from the Midwest devised a quick formula to calculate the price of a house in the Bay Area: See how much a similar house would cost in Minnesota and then add a million dollars. Every few weeks there seems to be another story in the California news media about a dilapidated shack in an ordinary neighborhood selling for seven figures, just to be torn down. It has become common enough to lose its shock value. California recorded another milestone last week, one reflecting a prouder facet of the stateís success. If the state were an independent country, its economy would rank as the fifth-largest in the world, ahead of Britainís (which has been crawling lately). California held that spot once before, but it slipped a bit during the Great Recession a decade ago. As the state has blossomed, outpacing many others, it has reinforced a liberal narrative about growth, that a state can have big government and a booming economy, too. (Texas is the conservativesí counterexample: a big, fast-growing economy under laissez-faire government.) California has strict environmental protections, a progressive tax system and an ascendant minimum wage, now $10.50 an hour and set to rise in stages to $15 in 2023. The state welcomes immigrants, celebrates ethnic and linguistic diversity, and actively tries to combat climate change. And with all that, its economy continues to soar. ìWe have raised income taxes and imposed increasingly high fees to reduce greenhouse emissions,î said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. ìNone of that has overridden the attractiveness of this state for talent and innovation and entrepreneurship.î Californiaís economic success underpins the stateís audacity and its defiance of President Trump. It is an invisible buttress when the governor and attorney general harangue the Trump administration, as they did recently at a news conference in Sacramento, for ìbasically going to war against the state of California.î California is not the only state doing well, of course. The federal Bureau of Economic Analysis produced a map last week showing a somewhat lopsided pattern of prosperity in America. The economies of states like Kansas and Louisiana shrank slightly last year, while those in the West thrived: Nevada grew by 3.5 percent, Washington by 4.4 percent, Arizona by 3.2 percent. Even among its booming neighbors, though, California, which saw 3 percent growth last year, stands out for the diversity and sheer size of its economy. Every sector contributed to the stateís growth last year except agriculture, according to Irena Asmundson, the chief economist of the California Department of Finance. Financial services and real estate led the pack, and even manufacturing, often said to be in decline in America, grew significantly, contributing $10 billion in output to the $127 billion the state added over all. ìMost of this is a lot of relatively small firms that are very specialized,î Ms. Asmundson said of the growth in manufacturing. Another barometer of growth is the surge in people using Californiaís airports, especially the regional ones. Airports in Long Beach, San Jose, San Luis Obispo and Sonoma all saw double-digit percentage increases in passenger traffic in 2017. Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley is a big part of Californiaís success. One of the stateís technology giants, Apple, brought in more revenue in its latest fiscal year ó $229 billion ó than the entire economic output of Wyoming, five times over. All of that money pouring in to Californiaís tech and entertainment industries produces a big wealth effect, ballooning what the stateís workers can spend ó and not just those who work directly in those fields. Facebook revealed last month that the median pay of its employees was $240,430 a year. But the fire chief in San Ramon has been doing pretty well, too, with total pay and benefits of $516,344 in 2016, according to the website Transparent California. And nearly 200 police officers across the state make more than $300,000 a year, when overtime and benefits are included. Like many states, California has persistent worries about how it will cover its pension obligations down the road, and those high rates of pay for public sector workers do not help matters. But in these boom times, Californiaís bright fiscal position is a world away from the federal governmentís. The state treasury is flush with cash, and is socking billions away in a rainy-day fund. When Gov. Jerry Brown returned to office in 2011, he faced a budget deficit of $27 billion. Now, after eight years of economic expansion, the state has a surplus of $6 billion, and its tax revenues are running well ahead of projections. Yet it is hard to overlook the pain that prosperity has brought: traffic, property prices, homelessness. Those last two issues are increasingly seen as sides of the same coin. In 2017, California saw the fastest growth in its homeless population of any state (14 percent), and also had the highest proportion of them unsheltered: 68 percent of the stateís 134,000 homeless people sleep outdoors. All economic booms run out of steam sooner or later, and some Californians say they might welcome a little relief from this one. William Yu, an economist with the Anderson Forecast at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management, recalls a panel discussion a month ago with real estate developers. ìOne developer was asked, ëAre you worried about a recession coming?íî Mr. Yu said. ìThe developer said, ëIím not worried at all. Iím waiting for it.íî Why? So he can snap up some properties at cheaper prices."

(Want to get California Today by email? Here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the sign-up.) How did Hakan Sukur ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a World Cup star, a veteran of some of Europe‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top soccer leagues and perhaps the most famous athlete in Turkey ‚<U+0080><U+0094> end up working in a bakery in Palo Alto? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s complicated. Mr. Sukur, now 46 and still with a face as well-known as anyone‚<U+0080><U+0099>s back in Turkey, left the country in 2015 after a short career as a member of Parliament. A year later, there were warrants for his arrest for his longtime support of the Gulenist movement, believed by some to be behind the deadly, failed 2016 coup to topple the authoritarian regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a former friend and political ally. No one, it seemed, knew where Mr. Sukur went. We found him hiding in plain sight near the Stanford campus, running a high-end cafe and bakery that features, among other items, a selection of Turkish food and coffees. In Turkey, during the good years, Mr. Sukur would be mobbed by fans. In Palo Alto, most customers do not recognize the man clearing dishes or bringing food and drinks to their table. Advertisement A decade ago, about when Mr. Sukur retired from soccer, Mr. Erdogan was steering Turkey toward the European Union. Mr. Sukur was elected to Parliament in 2011 as part of Mr. Erdogan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s party. But in recent years, Mr. Erdogan has clamped down on perceived threats ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the military, courts, media, even the internet. Tens of thousands of journalists, academics and political opponents have been detained. Mr. Sukur left Parliament, quit the party and quietly came to California to visit friends, he said. He soon decided to build a life in the Bay Area. He bought a share of Tuts Cafe and Bakery, which was under construction in downtown Palo Alto, and his wife and their three children, now ages 12, 16 and 18, later joined him. After the coup, Mr. Sukur‚<U+0080><U+0099>s houses and bank accounts in Turkey were seized, he said. His elderly father was jailed for months. Mr. Sukur presumes that he will never see his parents again. He does not know if he will ever return to Turkey. Still, he considers himself far luckier than the Turks who find themselves under the thumb of Mr. Erdogan and swept up by the political upheaval. His long-range plan is not to run bakeries, but to coach soccer and build sports academies ‚<U+0080><U+0094> something he always thought he would do in Turkey, with his fame and wealth. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Life is not where you live, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Sukur said over a plate of Turkish meatballs. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what you do where you live.‚<U+0080>ù Read the full story here.

The English-language newspaper, The Phnom Penh Post, reported the sale on Sunday. The investor, Siva Kumar G, is the chief executive of a public-relations firm that has worked on behalf of Prime Minister Hun Sen. The sale comes about seven months after the government forced The Postís longtime rival, The Cambodia Daily, to close over allegations that it had not paid millions of dollars in taxes, and two months before a general election. The Post itself had owed $3.9 million in taxes, but that bill was settled as part of the sale, The Post reported. As of Monday, there was no outward indication from The Postís coverage that its independence had been compromised, several politicians and journalists who follow Cambodian politics said in telephone interviews. But the managing editor resigned, and the mood in the newsroom was said to be grim. ìSomeone wanted to make sure the message was crystal clear: The Postís days as a proud, independent local English-language newspaper are numbered,î Sophal Ear, a Cambodia expert at Occidental College in Los Angeles, said in an email. ìAnd if one stake isnít enough through The Postís heart, a second one awaits.î For a quarter-century, as the United States and Europe helped Cambodia rebuild from the ravages of the genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge, they tied billions of dollars in aid to an effort to transform Cambodia into a liberal democracy. But in recent years Mr. Hun Sen has increasingly relied on Chinaís political and financial support. But even though the country is nominally democratic, Mr. Hun Sen, the longest-ruling leader in Asia, has recently shuttered dissenting news media outlets, jailed dozens of critics and dissolved the main opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, or C.N.R.P. ó apparently with Beijingís blessing. ìWith or without the sale, press freedom in Cambodia is close to nonexistent,î said Kem Monovithya, the opposition partyís deputy director general of public affairs and the daughter of its leader, Kem Sokha, who was detained in September and accused of plotting a United States-funded coup ó a charge he denies. Sam Rainsy, the former leader of the opposition party, who abruptly quit last year in the face of government pressure, said that The Post had recently published two of his letters to the editor, but that he did not expect the new management to continue the practice. ìThe prospects were already very bleak for a free and fair electionî in July, Mr. Sam Rainsy added in a telephone interview from Paris, where he lives in exile. ìBut the disappearance of The Phnom Penh Post as an independent newspaper makes those prospects even worse.î The Postís sale may indicate that Mr. Hun Sunís administration has decided that it no longer needs to allow a free media to operate in the country as a concession for getting Western aid, said Shawn Crispin, the Bangkok-based Southeast Asia representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonpartisan advocacy group based in New York. ìNow China is its main patron, and they have no such interests,î he said. Mr. Crispin said he worried that the tax bill The Post was facing might have been a pressure tactic used to force the newspaperís previous owner, Bill Clough, to sell, rather than fight the bill in court. In a video uploaded by The Phnom Penh Post last year, Mr. Clough said that the newspaperís independence and loyal following were its ìmajor distinguishing factorî and that his staff was ìremarkably freeî from government interference. On Monday morning, The Postís editor in chief, Kay Kimsong, did not respond to a message seeking Mr. Cloughís contact details. He referred questions to the newspaperís chief executive, Marcus Holmes, who did not immediately respond to an email. Two of Mr. Kay Kimsongís colleagues wrote on Twitter on Monday afternoon that Mr. Kay Kimsong himself had just been fired, and that at least four others had resigned. The newspaperís new owner, Mr. Siva, is the chief executive of Asia PR, a Malaysian firm based in Kuala Lumpur. Its website says, without elaborating, that Mr. Hun Senís ìentry into the government seatî was among its government-related projects. The paperís new ownership said Sunday in a statement that it was ìfully committedî to upholding the 26-year-old newspaperís ìprinciples/independence without infringing any relevant laws and regulations of the Kingdom of Cambodia,î The Post reported. But Mr. Sophal Ear, the analyst, said he saw the language about obeying laws as ìa signal to the authoritiesî about the newspaperís future. ìI think the odds are greater than 50/50 the paperís coverage will change, and for the worse,î he said. Asia PRís website calls Mr. Siva ìa journalist by discipline and training from the United Kingdom and Australiaî who was previously editor in chief of The Eastern Times, a newspaper in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. His personal assistant, Krishna Kumar, said Monday in an email that he was unavailable for comment and would be out of the office for about two weeks. On Sunday, reporters for The Post published a detailed article that explored years of apparent connections between Asia PR and the Cambodian and Malaysian governments. But the newspaperís managing editor, Stuart White, said in an email to The New York Times that he resigned on Monday morning after being told to remove the story. ìI wasnít given a reason, and was only told, through a co-worker, that it was a direct order from the new management,î Mr. White said."

Mr. Trump, who faces a deadline of May 12 to decide whether to withdraw from the Iran deal, has threatened to do so unless Britain, France and Germany agree to make wholesale changes to the agreement. The fear among investors is that a United States exit from the deal would probably lead to new oil sanctions being imposed on Iran, the worldís fifth-largest producer of crude oil last year, further curtailing a global supply that is already relatively tight. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ó the powerful cartel of oil-producing nations led by Saudi Arabia ó has restrained production since last year while making common cause with oil-dependent Russia to keep a cap on global supply and to prop up prices. The flow of oil to the global market has been further constricted as a result of the political and economic crisis plaguing Venezuela, another major producer of crude, in recent years. A boom in production in the United States has helped offset some of the tightening in recent months. But higher prices elsewhere have prompted American producers to sell on the global market, driving oil exports to record highs and pulling domestic oil prices higher. The cost of a gallon of gasoline in the United States has followed suit, with the national average price for unleaded regular climbing above $2.80 in recent days. Energy companies seem poised to benefit from the surge. The energy sector led the broader Standard & Poorís 500-stock index higher Monday, rising by more than 2 percent, compared with the broader index, which was up less than 1 percent."

Responding to the requests of party leaders who fear a win for Mr. Blankenship in the primary would all but ensure the re-election of Senator Joe Manchin II, a Democrat, Mr. Trump echoed those fears in a tweet aimed at West Virginians. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Don Blankenship currently running for Senate, can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t win the General Election in your State‚<U+0080>¶No way!‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Trump wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Remember Alabama.

The tweet was a political gift to Mr. Blankenship‚<U+0080><U+0099>s two main Republican rivals, Representative Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, in a state Mr. Trump won overwhelmingly and where he remains popular. It is unclear, though, how influential Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s intervention will be in a state where many early votes have already been cast. Advertisement But that Mr. Trump would step into the contest at all underscores how alarmed party officials are about Mr. Blankenship. The president has felt burned by Republicans when he injected himself into other races only to see his preferred candidates fall short. Should the Mr. Blankenship still win despite the intervention it would be highly embarrassing to Mr. Trump. In a statement responding to Mr. Trump, Mr. Blankenship said the president ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is a very busy man and he doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know me and he doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.‚<U+0080>ù He added that the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the President‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agenda.‚<U+0080>ù The former chief executive of Massey Energy, Mr. Blankenship served a year in federal prison after being convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety rules following the Upper Big Branch mining disaster in 2010 that claimed 29 lives. He has faced a series of attacks from establishment Republicans for his role in the tragedy. He has also been criticized for keeping his official residence in Las Vegas and refusing to fully disclose his financial holdings. The attacks sent Mr. Blankenship‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poll numbers tumbling, but with Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Morrisey dividing votes, Mr. Blankenship has remained in contention.

Mr. McConnell, who is deeply unpopular among Republican primary voters, has largely sidestepped the attacks, but his allies have continued to assail Mr. Blankenship. Republicans involved with the race have been pressuring the White House to speak out, but administration officials were not fully certain what Mr. Trump would do until they saw the tweet. Advertisement Republican strategists believe that Mr. Manchin offers them one of their best opportunities to reclaim a Democratic seat, but that the conservative Democrat and former governor will easily win re-election if Mr. Blankenship is the nominee. And it is an all too familiar feeling for Senate G.O.P. officials: in December, the party handed over the Alabama seat once held by Jeff Sessions to Doug Jones, a Democrat, after nominating Roy S. Moore, a controversial former state judge who was accused by multiple women of making advances on them when they were teenagers, allegations that Mr. Moore denied. Mr. Morrissey seized on the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recommendation in a tweet of his own, saying Mr. Blankenship would be a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>disaster‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> in the general election. .@realDonaldTrump is exactly right. @DonBlankenship would be a disaster for West Virginia and would get trounced by @Sen_JoeManchin. Help Trump and the conservative fighter defeat this convicted criminal. #wvsen https://t.co/tgpuXpEDY5"

But it turns out they may be letting their feet do some of the talking, too. Using tools designed for detecting earthquakes, researchers found that different elephant activities ó walking, running, snorting, grunting ó create distinct ìseismic signaturesî in the ground. In some cases, according to a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology, these vibrations travel farther through the ground than they could through the air, giving the animals a variety of powerful methods for long-distance communication. ìItís not surprising that walking affects their vibrations, but theyíre so big that their snorts and grunts also generate very low-frequency vibrations,î said Beth Mortimer, a biologist at both the Universities of Oxford and Bristol and lead author of the study. ìAnd by monitoring the vibrations through the ground, we could determine what the elephants were doing.î Earlier studies have shown that elephants may be monitoring ground vibrations through their bodies, a trait more commonly associated with small creatures like scorpions and insects. For example, elephants have been observed fleeing for higher ground in the moments before distant tsunamis, and a mother elephant who feels threatened will stomp on the ground to warn others away. By suggesting that elephants not only cause distinct vibrations with different activities, but can perceive the difference from great distances, the research expands the possibilities of what the animals may be communicating. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] It also presents a new opportunity for researchers and conservationists looking to surveil the animals at a distance, a tactic that could be useful for saving a species that is threatened by poachers. ìWhat weíve shown is that we can basically use this as a remote monitoring strategy,î said Dr. Mortimer. Despite international efforts to ban the trade of ivory dating back decades, tens of thousands of African elephants continue to be killed for their tusks every year. To conduct the study, the researchers planted devices known as geophones near wild elephants in Kenya. Like seismographs, geophones convert ground vibrations into measurable electronic signals, but are smaller, lighter and better suited to field work. With these tools, researchers hypothesized that they could, ìtriangulate where different seismic forces are coming from,î to track and protect the animals, said Dr. Mortimer. The researchers then used computer models to show that the vibrations they recorded could be detected and distinguished nearly four miles away under optimal conditions. By comparison, an elephantís trumpet can typically only travel about two miles through the air, said Dr. Mortimer. Optimal conditions are tough to come by in a world of noisy humans, however. ìAny kind of noise pollution thatís vibrating the ground, even car noise, dramatically reduces the ability to detect and discriminate these vibrations,î said Dr. Mortimer. And that may put elephants at more risk than they already face. Because they live in complex, spatially separated communities, elephants depend on long-distance communication to survive. Ground vibrations may be used to warn one another of danger, and also to find mates during an elephantís very brief mating period. ìFor elephants to find one another, they need to be able to advertise their fertility,î Dr. Mortimer said."

Emails Show an Effort to Shield Pruitt From Public Scrutiny,New files suggest the E.P.A. chief‚<U+0080><U+0099>s close control of his public events is driven more by a desire to avoid tough questions than by security concerns.,"Eric Lipton, Lisa Friedman",Climate,Domestic Politics,"US Politics, Environment, Regulation and Deregulation, EPA, Sierra Club, Scott Pruitt, Kevin Chmielewski, Richard Smotkin, Donald Trump","WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The invitation-only breakfast at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington gathered 250 executives from the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s largest electric utilities, assembled in a ballroom to meet with Scott Pruitt, who a month before had started his new job as chief of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt had spent the previous six years as Oklahoma‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attorney general attacking E.P.A. regulations in court, often in coordination with energy giants. Now he ran the agency, and he was ready to lay out his vision for the energy executives. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whoever said you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have your cake and eat it too, doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know what to do with cake, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Pruitt said, according to a speech prepared for the March 2017 event. Details from the breakfast, and dozens of other official appearances from Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s scandal-plagued first year at the E.P.A., have until now been hidden from public view as a result of an extraordinary effort by Mr. Pruitt and his aides to maintain strict secrecy about the bulk of his daily schedule. But a new cache of emails covering most of Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first year heading the E.P.A. shows that the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s close control of his public events is driven more by a desire to avoid tough questions from the public than by concerns about security, contradicting Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longstanding defense of his secretiveness. Advertisement The more than 10,000 documents, made public as part of a Freedom of Information lawsuit by the Sierra Club, an environmental organization, offer visibility for the first time not only into many of Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s appearances nationwide but into the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s aggressive concealment of his activities as a public servant. The files show an agency focused on dividing people into ‚<U+0080><U+009C>friendly and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unfriendly‚<U+0080>ù camps and which, on one occasion, a secret visit to a Toyota plant, became so focused on not disclosing the trip that his hosts expressed confusion about the publicity value of the visit. In another instance, planning what was billed as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>town hall‚<U+0080>ù discussion for farmers in Iowa, the E.P.A. emails show that the chief concern among Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top aides to control who would actually be allowed to ask him questions. Ultimately, the agency scripted questions for Mr. Pruitt to answer from the stage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The security aspect is smoke and mirrors, ‚<U+0080>ù said Kevin Chmielewski, Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s former deputy chief of staff for operations, who is one of several former E.P.A. officials who have said that they were fired or sidelined for disagreeing with Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s management practices. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want anybody to question anything, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Chmielewski said, adding that Mr. Pruitt ‚<U+0080><U+009C>just doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand what it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like to be a public figure.‚<U+0080>ù Three other current and former agency officials, who asked not to be identified because they still work for the government, expressed similar views. The E.P.A. did not respond to requests for comment about the documents, which detail Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plans for travel and appearances nationwide. In the past, E.P.A. officials have said that Mr. Pruitt has faced an unprecedented number of death threats, which account for the size of his security force and the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to make public his daily schedule. Mr. Pruitt testified before Congress last month that Mr. Chmielewski had resigned. All politicians are attuned to image-building, of course, and employ staffs whose job is to control the environments in which they appear. Mr. Pruitt, though, has carried the practice to an extreme. Breaking with all of his predecessors at the E.P.A. for the last 25 years, as well as other members of President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cabinet, he does not release a list of public speaking events and he discloses most official trips only after they are over. Mr. Pruitt doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t hold news conferences, and in one episode, journalists who learned of an event were ejected from the premises after an E.P.A. official threatened to call the police. The E.P.A. also declined to make public a copy of Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s detailed calendar until it was sued by The New York Times and other organizations. More recently, the agency moved to require that any documents related to Mr. Pruitt that are gathered as a result of Freedom of Information requests be provided to his political aides 48 hours in advance for an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>awareness review‚<U+0080>ù before they are made public, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to insure that leadership is aware of public disclosures, ‚<U+0080>ù a June email said. Advertisement Mr. Pruitt currently faces 11 investigations into his spending and management at the E.P.A., many of which stem from the appetite for secrecy. He is under investigation for first-class travel at taxpayer expense, his elaborate security detail and the purchase of a $43,000 soundproof booth for making telephone calls. Separately, a New York Times investigation found that, in 2003 when he served as a legislator in Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt bought a home in a transaction that involved two lobbyists with business before the state, and disguised the purchase by using a shell company. The emails document Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top aides taking steps to block the public from his appearances. For example, in Nevada, Iowa, organizers of an event celebrating Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plans to repeal an Obama-era water regulation that many ranchers dislike informed the E.P.A. that they had already announced the event as open. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This has been sold as a town hall meeting‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> meaning anyone could ask questions ‚<U+0080><U+0094> wrote Bill Couser, an Iowa cattle farmer who was helping organize the December event, in an email to the E.P.A. In Washington, E.P.A. officials objected. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>With a crowd of 300 people plus open press, we have to stick with the questions we currently have, ‚<U+0080>ù Millan Hupp, Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s scheduling director, replied. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My sincere apologies for causing any difficulty but we cannot do open q&a from the crowd.‚<U+0080>ù The agency prevailed. Mr. Pruitt answered questions presented to him by Mr. Couser that were written by E.P.A. officials, according to the emails and a video recording of the event. Efforts like these to prevent reporters from attending events were not a part of the playbook for past E.P.A. administrators, according to spokeswomen for Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George W. Bush administration, and Lisa Jackson and Gina McCarthy, who served under President Barack Obama. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t selectively inform the press or take any steps to keep things secret, ‚<U+0080>ù Heather Grizzle, a spokeswoman for Ms. Whitman, said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Mr. Pruitt takes a different approach. The emails show agency officials defining prospective guests at events as friendly or unfriendly, and reorganizing events at the last minute if there are concerns that people who are considered unfriendly might show up. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sixteen friendly Industry leaders will be invited to attend they will arrive at 8:30 with the Administrator expected to arrive at 9:00 a.m., ‚<U+0080>ù said one memo, shared among top E.P.A. officials last September, in advance of a visit by Mr. Pruitt to Colorado Springs, where Mr. Pruitt was scheduled to speak with the National Association of Homebuilders. The event was closed to the public and not announced publicly ahead of time. Advertisement Gerald M. Howard, the organization‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top executive, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>will moderate Q&A on Industry issues set forth in advance and possibly from the audience ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who are all industry friendly and supportive of Mr. Pruitt and his efforts, ‚<U+0080>ù the description said. In another instance, after a Missouri news outlet discovered, and tweeted, that Mr. Pruitt was planning to speak to about 150 representatives of electric cooperatives and power-plant owners last April, E.P.A. staff went into damage-control mode. The meeting had not been publicly disclosed. Tate Bennett, who as associate administrator at the E.P.A. is in charge of environmental education, asked Barry Hart of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives if the news organization, Missouri Network Television, was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the friendly outlet.‚<U+0080>ù Shaun Kober, founder of Missouri Network Television, said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we just try to lay out the facts.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Hart replied, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is, but since it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a public tweet you have to assume the world now knows including all news media ‚<U+0080>¶ even unfriendly.‚<U+0080>ù The group, in consultation with the E.P.A., had already discussed a strategy to counteract any negative comments that appeared on social media. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our plan will be to promote the feel-good activity and news from the event, ‚<U+0080>ù Gus Wagner, a public relations executive working with organizers, wrote in one email shared with the E.P.A. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Comments that are positive will be liked and possibly shared, ‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Comments that are derogatory and/or abusive will be hidden from public view. Commenter receives no notification this hiding has happened.‚<U+0080>ù Sometimes the E.P.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s approach to public relations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> issuing announcements only after events were over ‚<U+0080><U+0094> confused its hosts. Among them was Stephen Ciccone, a vice president for government affairs at Toyota Motor North America, which organized a visit by Mr. Pruitt to its Texas auto plant in August. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought you all did not want any press coverage?‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Ciccone wrote, unsure as to why the E.P.A. would issue a news release at all. Advertisement An email back from the E.P.A. explained the plan. The agency welcomed coverage as long as it was on the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s terms. A release would be made ‚<U+0080><U+009C>highlighting all the stops Administrator Pruitt makes during his visit to Texas, ‚<U+0080>ù the email said. As planned, government-issued photos of a smiling Mr. Pruitt and executives from Toyota were posted on the E.P.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website soon after the event was over, describing it as an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>action tour.‚<U+0080>ù The effort to control the event almost fell apart when one journalist caught wind of the trip. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We just received an inquiry from a CBS News reporter in Dallas about the visit, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Ciccone wrote to the E.P.A. on the day of the event. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t reply until the visit is over.‚<U+0080>ù In another instance not previously made public, Mr. Pruitt last June aided one of his longtime supporters, Richard Smotkin, who at that time was a Comcast lobbyist and who later helped organize Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s controversial trip to Morocco. (A month after that December trip, Mr. Smotkin became a $40,000-a-month foreign agent promoting Morocco‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interests abroad.) Mr. Smotkin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s June request ran into ethics questions within the E.P.A.: He had invited Mr. Pruitt to a fund-raiser for a nonprofit group that Mr. Smotkin helps run, the American Council of Young Political Leaders, which offers foreign-exchange programs for emerging political leaders. At the event, Mr. Pruitt would be presented with an award in the form of a globe engraved with his name. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Ethics department is asking me these questions about the event, ‚<U+0080>ù wrote Sydney Hupp, Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s scheduler (and the sister of Millan Hupp, who is also a scheduler for Mr. Pruitt. Both are former Pruitt campaign aides.) The questions had to do with the appropriateness of receiving an award at a fund-raising event. After a series of emails, Millan Hupp wrote back to the staff at the nonprofit group with a solution: Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t refer Mr. Pruitt‚<U+0080><U+0099>s job during the presentation. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Yes, the Administrator may attend the event, and yes, he may receive the globe. But please do ensure that they refer to him as the Honorable (as opposed to the EPA Administrator)‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Hupp wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So, yay! It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been approved through ethics.‚<U+0080>ù"

Supporting Eric Reid,"Reid, a free agent safety, says the league has blackballed him for his protests during the national anthem.",Victor Mather,Sports,Sports,"Football, Eric Reid","The N.F.L. Players Association filed a grievance against the league on behalf of Eric Reid on Monday. Reid, the free agent safety who has knelt during the national anthem at games for the past two seasons, had filed a grievance of his own last week against the N.F.L., saying the league had blackballed him because of his actions. Released by the 49ers, he has yet to find a new team. The former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who led a wave of sideline demonstrations against social injustice and police brutality against African-Americans, filed a similar grievance last season. It is still being adjudicated. The players association said in a statement that the collective bargaining agreement had been violated in Reidís case. It contended that ìA club appears to have based its decision not to sign a player based on the playerís statement that he would challenge the implementation of a clubís policy prohibiting demonstration.î It also claimed that ìat least one club owner has asked pre-employment interview questions about a playerís intent to demonstrate. We believe these questions are improper, given league policy.î The union did not identify the teams involved. Reid is known to have met with the Bengals. The N.F.L. did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It had declined to comment after Reid filed his grievance last week."

Schuetze, Anna Codrea-Rado, Tacey Rychter, Elisabeth Vincentelli",Music,International,"Eurovision, Pop Rock Music, Europe","When the contestants in the Eurovision Song Contest take the stage in Lisbon this week, they will be part of a giant edition of the zany annual pop competition. Forty-three countries will compete for the prize, which will be awarded in a grand final on Saturday. At the first contest in Switzerland in 1956, there were just 14 entries ‚<U+0080><U+0094> two each from seven West European nations. Participation by countries behind the Iron Curtain would have been unthinkable. But socialist Yugoslavia joined in 1961, and the competition since then has become ever more international and inclusive. Israel first appeared in 1973; Australia, which broadcast the competition without taking part since the 1980s, has been sending contestants since 2015. Despite its distinctly ‚<U+0080><U+009C>euro‚<U+0080>ù sensibility ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which can be puzzling to the uninitiated ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Eurovision is now a global phenomenon with fans all over the world. In the age of video streaming and social media, it has never been easier to follow. Advertisement We met four Eurovision superfans to find out how they watch the contest, and what it means to them. Mr. Lochthove‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parents allowed him to stay up late to watch the contest one evening in 1982, and he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been a fan ever since. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not just the event, he said, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s also the fans. For him, 2010 was an especially great year, because Germany came together to support its entry. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There were huge public viewings, everyone was so enthusiastic, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. Mr. Lochthove, 45, recalled how hosting the soccer World Cup in 2010 had given Germany the opportunity to shed its postwar suspicion of flags and national pride to cheer on its team. But for Mr. Lochthove, the most important competition that year was Eurovision, held in Oslo, which the German singer Lena won. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She managed to cast a spell on the whole audience, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. Germany, despite being the one of the most populous countries in the contest, has won Eurovision only twice. Ireland is the most successful country, with seven wins; Sweden comes next, with six; and Britain and France have five each. (Germany‚<U+0080><U+0099>s soccer team has performed much better.) Eurovision is followed by fans all year, even if the public at large tends to forget about it between the major competitions. Mr. Lochthove runs a club called ESC-Fans Berlin that puts on monthly karaoke parties. It also meets to watch and discuss the national contests that run throughout the year to select the acts that will compete in Eurovision. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Of course, May is the high season, but we have things going on all year, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. In July, Mr. Lochthove‚<U+0080><U+0099>s club is planning a weekend of parties, karaoke and quizzes in Berlin, in conjunction with an Israeli Eurovision club; in September, some members of ESC-Fans Berlin will take part in a three-day cruise organized by a group of Finnish fans. Fan groups from other countries are not as well organized as the German ones, Mr. Lochthove said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But, ‚<U+0080>ù he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s all part of the wonderful cultural exchange.‚<U+0080>ù For a Eurovision superfan like Mr. Sheen, 54, nothing comes close to watching the contest live. He hosted watching parties for 20 years in his backyard in Colchester, England, but now travels to attend the contest in person. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t go any higher with the parties, ‚<U+0080>ù he said on Wednesday in a telephone interview from the Altice Arena in Lisbon, the site of this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s competition. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to be with more Eurovision people.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Mr. Sheen said that he held his first Eurovision party in 1991. Each year, the shindigs grew more elaborate as he added score sheets, themed food, colored spotlights, a sound system and a smoke machine. His 10th party, in 2005, coincided with Eurovision‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 50th anniversary; Mr. Sheen pulled out all the stops. The mother of a regular guest baked a two-tier cake in the national colors of the host country that year, Denmark. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got 50 gold, helium-filled balloons and tied flags from each of the countries with ribbons to them, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. Some guests dressed up that year, prompting Mr. Sheen to start theming the parties. One year was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vampires and drama queens, ‚<U+0080>ù he said; the year of the financial crisis in 2009 was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>black, white and red.‚<U+0080>ù Another year, guests wore costumes from a country of their choice. Mr. Sheen said his earliest memory of Eurovision was as a child in 1972, the year the New Seekers represented Britain with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Beg, Steal or Borrow.‚<U+0080>ù From those earliest days, for him, Eurovision was about community. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s all about friends and extended family, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. The parties were Mr. Sheen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way of replicating the spirit of togetherness that Eurovision represents. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s always been a great way to bring people together and to appreciate each other‚<U+0080><U+0099>s culture, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. He added that doing so was all the more important in today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political climate in Europe. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People always want to talk about Brexit and how you see it politically, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The politicians argue about this, that and the other; we argue about a song.‚<U+0080>ù In 2011, Mr. Sheen drove to D√ºsseldorf, Germany, to be in the audience for the first time. While the parties were dear to him, nothing beat the thrill of the real thing, he said. And he hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t looked back. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When Ms. Bresic was growing up in the 1970s in the western suburbs of Sydney, she knew about the Eurovision Song Contest from Croatian-language radio and from her parents‚<U+0080><U+0099> friends. But she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t see the competition until an Australian TV channel started broadcasting it in 1983, when Ms. Bresic was 15. She and her family were hooked. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We would often stay up until ridiculous times to watch it, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Bresic, 50, said. Her parents were Croatian migrants who met in Sydney. The way they watched the contest in the 1980s was influenced by the complicated politics of the Balkans at the time. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mum and Dad wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be interested in watching any of the performances by certain countries, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Bresic said. When Yugoslavia won the contest in 1989, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My parents were outraged, ‚<U+0080>ù she said, because, in their mind, the winning band, Riva, was Croatian, not Yugoslavian. Ms. Bresic went to school in Ashfield, a suburb where, in the mid-1980s, nearly half the residents had been born overseas. Some of her schoolmates watched Eurovision, but it was a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cultural shame, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Bresic said. There was a cringe factor attached to liking something ‚<U+0080><U+009C>so foreign, ‚<U+0080>ù she added. As an Australian born to migrant parents, Ms. Bresic said she felt a sense of belonging when watching Eurovision, but also ‚<U+0080><U+009C>judgment, too.‚<U+0080>ù She said she often watched the live broadcast in the small hours with friends or family around a table laden with pens and tally sheets, as well as smoked meats, pickled cabbage, nutty cakes and strong stovetop coffee. (This year, the grand final from Lisbon begins at 5 a.m. Sydney time.) In other years, Ms. Bresic said, she has thrown parties at a more reasonable hour to watch a recording of the show. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when she breaks out the liquor ‚<U+0080><U+0094> homemade grappa, plum brandy and limoncello. Since her parents died, it has been harder to find ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the old-timers who do that stuff, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Bresic said, referring to Eurovision parties. But watching the contest reminds her of her mother and father, she said, and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>their preferred bubblegum-pop style‚<U+0080>ù with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>folkloric traditions thrown in.‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Bresic tries to get her children, who are in their early 20s, to watch with her ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but, she said, they usually just roll their eyes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe in five or six years‚<U+0080><U+0099> time, ‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they might think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quite a cool thing.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mohammed has a singular way of keeping track of time. Asked when he started his Eurovision viewing party at Hardware, a gay bar in Hell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Kitchen, New York, he replied, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Emmelie de Forest won that year.‚<U+0080>ù (For the uninitiated, that would be 2013.) He also remembered a trip to London, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the year Nicki French represented England‚<U+0080>ù (otherwise known as 2000). Advertisement Mr. Mohammed, a.k.a. D.J. ohRicky, discovered Eurovision as a child in his native Trinidad, via British broadcasts. Access to the contest was more difficult when he moved to New York in 1986 at age 16, and he would keep up by buying import singles and watching VHS tapes mailed by a friend of a friend. In 1997, he started working for a company that distributed music videos to clubs and bars across the United States. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would contact the record labels overseas to get the videos they made specifically for Eurovision, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mohammed said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got the Dana International video for ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Diva‚<U+0080><U+0099> from Germany and I put it in the clubs over here, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, referring to the transgender Israeli winner of the 1998 competition. Mr. Mohammed, whose Eurovision favorite is the 1973 Spanish entry ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eres T√∫‚<U+0080>ù by Mocedades, said the closest analogy for the contest was Broadway. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those fans know the statistics, like how many Tonys someone won, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the same for Eurovision die-hards: They know the last time a country won, who wrote a particular song.‚<U+0080>ù The first time that Hardware hosted the live feed, in 2013, the owners underestimated the show‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pulling power, even on a Saturday afternoon. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t move in there at all, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mohammed said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They ran out of champagne because they kept making mimosas and bellinis.‚<U+0080>ù The crowd consists mostly of expats, and it is similar for the Eurovision dances that Mr. Mohammed runs at Hardware throughout the year. Some Americans are happy to join in the fun, while others are baffled. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Two months ago, I had a Eurovision party and, right after that, there was a drag show by Mon√©t X Change, who has a completely different crowd, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mohammed said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The last half-hour of my set is when I play all the big songs, like Ruslana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Wild Dances, ‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Take Me to Your Heaven, ‚<U+0080><U+0099> Verka Serduchka, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Euphoria.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I looked at these Americans waiting for the next show and it was a complete culture shock for them. ‚<U+0080><U+0098>What the hell is going on?‚<U+0080><U+0099> is the first reaction. The second is, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Why is everybody on the dance floor and singing along?‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mohammed laughed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pretty consistent with Americans reacting to Eurovision for the first time.‚<U+0080>ù Christopher F.

And the uprising changed their lives.",Corinne Maier,Opinion,International,"Women's rights;Feminism, Women and Girls, Civil Unrest, Marie-France Pisier, Anne Wiazemsky, France","PARIS ó One of my biggest regrets is that I was born too late for the barricades of May 1968. I was only 4 years old, and so I missed this huge ìhappening,î the student and worker uprising that brought France to a standstill. My motherís sister, who was then a 22-year-old elementary school teacher here, recalled with nostalgia the strange atmosphere in the city, where, she said, ìthe daily routine stopped and everyone went on a picnic.î Thanks to Aunt Anne-Marie, who told me several times of ìherî May í68, Iíve always viewed the protests from a female perspective. At first glance, however, women are rarely visible. Histories devoted to May í68 (Iím thinking particularly of the famous ìGenerationsî by HervÈ Hamon and Patrick Rotman) focus on the men, some of whom became prominent writers, architects and politicians. Photographs of the uprising by Gilles Caron, Marc Riboud, Bruno Barbey and Henri Cartier-Bresson also chiefly show men ó many of them glamorous young rebels like Daniel Cohn-Bendit, portrayed with all the allure of rock stars. William Kleinís documentary ìMaydays,î filmed in Paris in 1968, is revealing: In all the meetings, debates, marches and street protests, you can see very few women. Sure, there is a woman working as part of a medical team, obviously a nurse; another woman answers the phone for a student coordinating committee; a third takes care of militantsí children at an impromptu nursery at the Sorbonne. Nurse, secretary, babysitter ó all traditional roles. So should May í68 be considered a ìguy thingî? Women certainly took part, but most of the time they were in the background. In the factories, they were among the mass of striking workers, or joined demonstrations as the wives of strikers. In Paris, it was uncommon for them to give speeches, and even rarer for them to lead a committee. Instead, the most cited contributions by women to the uprising involve celebrities acting in a supporting role: The actress Marie-France Pisier smuggled Mr. Cohn-Bendit across the border in the trunk of her car so he could avoid arrest. Anne Wiazemsky, an actress and the wife of the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, crisscrossed Paris in roller skates and joined the protest against the eviction of the film archivist Henri Langlois from the government-subsidized CinÈmathËque. The novelist FranÁoise Sagan showed up in her luxury car at the barricades, prompting a protester to scoff, ìYouíve come with your Ferrari, Comrade Sagan?î Without blinking an eye, she shot back, ìItís a Maserati, Comrade.î At the protests, the most visible women were the ones hoisted onto the shoulders of men, like the celebrated ìMarianne of í68,î Caroline de Bendern. A model and daughter of an aristocratic family, she was photographed by Jean-Pierre Rey waving the Vietcong flag during a demonstration. The shot, published in Life magazine, became world famous. So symbols, yes, leaders, no. ìThere were a lot of us at the protests, but not in front,î my aunt said. ìIn the beginning, I watched, I listened. It took me time to become really involved.î Simone de Beauvoirís ìThe Second Sexî had been published two decades earlier, and in the United States the womenís movement was sweeping universities, but single-sex high schools were still common and the reins of power were still all held by men. Young womenís sexuality was still monitored and controlled, and even though sales of the pill had recently been approved, obtaining it was difficult. Not surprisingly, then, on the picket lines and at the occupied universities, women did not have an equal voice. For the sociologist Jean-Pierre Le Goff, the women of May í68 were restricted to roles as secretaries and helpmeets to men, ìconsigned to tending to the Maoist and Trotskyite male warriorsî of the uprising. But itís not as simple as that, for something was stirring among women, and May í68 crystallized it. In the same year as the revolt, small groups of women sprang up to debate womenís liberation with visiting American feminists in Paris. Two of the pioneers of French feminism, Anne Zelensky and Jacqueline Feldman, organized a meeting in the occupied Sorbonne to discuss the status of women. Feminist manifestoes led to the birth a few years later of Franceís Mouvement de LibÈration des Femmes, the Womenís Liberation Movement. May í68 was also ìthe first time women spoke out,î Aunt Anne-Marie said, the first time they had the courage to say no, as in the case of the female worker at the Wonder battery factory in St.-Ouen, just north of Paris, who refused to go back on the job at the end of the strike there in June. A short movie beloved by film scholars shows the woman protesting the settlement of the strike as her male colleagues stream obediently back into the factory. And in the years after the uprising, some women transformed their lives. Caroline de Bendern moved to Africa to make a movie and an album and live the sort of wild existence that anticipated the í70s. Ewa Rudling, a former model married to the grandson of the painter Matisse, abandoned her comfortable life to become a photographer ó she took her first shots at the protests, and got them published in The Observer. As for Aunt Anne-Marie, she quit her teaching job, moved out of her parentsí home and went to live in a commune in the countryside with an activist she met at a protest. ìI left the house with a single suitcase, slammed the door and felt free, free, free,î she said. ìFor the first time, I dared.î"

And yet, there is a case to be made. I was reminded of this on a recent visit for lunch one rainy Monday afternoon. My friend had arrived early and, displaying the healthy sense of self-importance necessary to psychological survival in Manhattan, demanded a table better than the dark one in a corner we were going to be given. Ordinarily we might have enjoyed the privacy of something quieter, but we wanted an unobstructed view in the event that Michael Cohen showed up. A few days earlier, Mr. Cohen, the 45th president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s embattled lawyer, had eaten at Freds with Donny Deutsch, the advertising executive and television commentator who last year, during a segment on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Morning Joe, ‚<U+0080>ù invited President Trump to a round of physical combat (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Donald if you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re watching, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re from Queens. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll meet you in the schoolyard, brother‚<U+0080>ù). Later, Page Six reported that Mr. Deutsch was dating the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s second ex-wife, Marla Maples. Mr. Deutsch is a longstanding patron of Freds, which is not short on affection for boys from Queens who have done well enough to make a habit of $38 salads, or lacking in tolerance for those from the Five Towns whose offices have just been raided by federal law enforcement officials. There, but for the grace of the RICO statute, go so many of us. Advertisement Freds is the creation of another boy from Queens, the chef Mark Strausman, who grew up in Flushing, as he recounts in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Freds at Barneys New York Cookbook, ‚<U+0080>ù which he wrote with Susan Littlefield and which has just been published by Grand Central Life & Style. Mr. Strausman flunked out of various colleges before rising to prominence in the late 1980s, serving Tuscan food to East Side plutocrats. The Pressman family, which had established Barneys as a men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wear outlet in downtown Manhattan in the 1920s before eventually turning it into something far more ambitious, brought him in to develop a restaurant similar to those at Harrods or Harvey Nichols in London where, with great novelty at the time, you could have sushi served to you from a conveyor belt. The result, which opened in 1996, was a restaurant in a department store rather than a department-store restaurant, which carries a meaningful distinction. The department store evolved in the early 20th century into a place of leisure, intended to transform the consumer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s understanding of shopping as an experience rooted in pleasure rather than duty. In 1914, Lord & Taylor opened in Manhattan with a manicure parlor for men, a mechanical horse and three places to eat. By the middle of the century, the department store had become a more overtly gendered environment, and the sort of restaurant you would find in it bore few traces of masculine inclination. Freds, which eventually spawned branches downtown, in Chicago and in Beverly Hills, Calif., was in its own way revolutionary because it extended itself to both sexes, to the enterprising and busy, refusing to encode female indolence. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have always hated the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>ladies who lunch, ‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Strausman told me. Absent were the pastels and aviary themes that distinguished similar ventures. The portions were ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and remain ‚<U+0080><U+0094> quite large to match the appetites, symbolic if not literal, of those who come. The food is the food of people who relish consistency (the trainer every morning at 5:30, dinner every Tuesday at Nello): Caprese salad, pizza margherita, tuna tartare, Belgian pommes frites, chicken Milanese, chicken paillard, chicken soup. Freds‚<U+0080><U+0099> chopped chicken salad ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a tumble of avocado, bibb lettuce, pears, string beans and meat ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has, for years, been the most popular item on the menu. The recipe is included in the new cookbook. But more than a cooking manual, the book comes to us as a memoir and artifact for members of the restaurant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s de facto fraternity, which over the years has included Laura Bush, Bruce Springsteen, Rudolph Giuliani, Jack Welch, Hugh Grant, Julianna Margulies, various members of the Tisch family and executives of the Corcoran real-estate empire. (I asked Mr. Strausman how long Mr. Cohen had been coming. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We started noticing him when he made himself be noticed.‚<U+0080>ù) Advertisement On the day I visited most recently, the dining room was busy and full, as it has been every time I have gone over the past decade. My friend and I were flanked by two Argentine tourists. There were tables of businessmen; a table of women in head scarves; a table of women who looked as if they had watched ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jersey Shore‚<U+0080>ù and not been frightened. Mr. Strausman no longer presides over the day-to-day operations of the dining room; instead it is Alfredo Escobar who stands in the role of executive chef, having come to this country from Mexico when he was 16 and worked his way up from a job as a line cook.

But in few areas do the two systems diverge more than on freedom of expression. ìNo purpose,î the Supreme Court observed in 1941, ìin ratifying the Bill of Rights was clearer than that of securing for the people of the United States much greater freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and petition than the people of Britain had ever enjoyed.î A decision a few weeks ago by the English High Court illustrates the magnitude of the differences. The European Union has adopted what is generally referred to as the ìright to be forgotten,î based on a 2014 ruling of the European Court of Justice. At the heart of that ruling is the determination that Google and other search engines must remove links to content published years before that was harmful to personal reputation but that is now deemed to be ìirrelevant or no longer relevant.î Google and other entities that carry such data are, upon receiving complaints from people who maintain that published information about them is no longer relevant, must make an initial determination as to whether to delete the challenged information. If the offended individual disagrees, he or she may go to court to seek an order requiring the deletion. Truth is no defense for Google; lack of continued ìrelevanceî carries the day. Since the 2014 ruling establishing the ìright to be forgottenî Google has received over 2.4 million such requests and has acceded to their pleas about 43 percent of the time. In the recent case decided by the English High Court, the first to be decided in that country, Google declined to do so. Two British businessmen who had been convicted of crimes brought the cases. Both claimed, in separate cases, that their convictions were no longer relevant. One had been convicted over 10 years before of ìconspiracy to carry out surveillanceî and served six months in prison. The other had been convicted in the late 1990s of ìconspiracy to account falselyî and had been imprisoned for four years. The judge ruled in favor of the former applicant, concluding that he had acknowledged his guilt, that there appeared to be no risk of repetition and that the published material was ìout of date, irrelevant, and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google Search to justify its continued availability.î He ruled against the other applicant, concluding that he had not ìaccepted his guilt, has misled the public and this Court, and shows no remorse.î Viewed through American eyes, every aspect of the courtís ruling would have been at odds with the First Amendment. The published material was true. The businessman-former convict who prevailed before the court had been duly convicted and jailed. There was not even a claim that the conviction had been wrongly imposed. In fact, the judge cited the acknowledgment of guilt by the individual seeking to bar Google from including his name as a factor in favor of suppressing that fact from Google users. An American judge confronted with such a case would probably have responded that the First Amendment would not permit even the beginning of engagement in what is nothing less than official censorship. Yet the door is not completely closed to the importation into America of the notion that certain truths may not be set forth by certain entities. A state assemblyman has introduced legislation that would create a version of a ìright to be forgottenî law in New York. While there seems little doubt that the courts would hold any such legislation to be unconstitutional, the fact that it has even been introduced illustrates the appeal of limitations on the dissemination of older information, however accurate the data may be. The imposition of a fine against Google in France of $112,000 for failing to remove certain materials from its American servers may pose an even greater threat of enforced silence on American companies. Given First Amendment protections, no American court would be inclined to enforce such an order. But if the ultimate decision of the European Court of Justice is that such a ruling is enforceable throughout Europe, Google will have little ability to resist. Government action limiting the publication of truthful speech, let alone such speech about judicial proceedings, is nothing less than a form of rewriting history. And as is frequently the case with censorship, it is contagious. In 2015, The Telegraph, an English newspaper, summarized 100 articles it had published that had been removed from search results in the year since the European Court of Justice articulated the right to be forgotten. They included articles about the convictions of individuals of crimes and the acquittals of others; various investigations, arrests and litigations; the conduct of police officers, teachers and other employees; and a wide array of conduct that had been deemed newsworthy by the newspaper and the publication of which had not been held to violate any British law. The dangers of one generation suppressing information about events of a previous one have not been limited to the imposition of content restrictions on Google. The same restrictions have been applied to online copies of newspapers that published truthful articles years before. In Belgium in 2016, for example, a superior court ordered a newspaper to delete from a 22-year-old article in its online archives the name of the driver who was in an accident that resulted in two deaths. That censorship of speech was the natural consequence of requiring older facts to be forgotten. The appeal of erasing certain facts is understandable. But the danger of allowing governmental suppression of truth is real. One need not envisage a dystopian world to recall Orwellís enduring warning that ìfreedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.î"

The case had been closely watched by migrant relief and rescue groups, especially in Denmark and Spain, where the volunteers were from, because their defense lawyers and supporters said it was an attempt to criminalize humanitarian action. The issue has taken on broad importance across Europe and especially in the Mediterranean as the migrant crisis has continued, if at a lower level than when the defendants in Greece volunteered two years ago. The political divisions stoked by migration have left the line between humanitarian intervention and criminal interaction increasingly treacherous to navigate in many countries for nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a strong signal to other NGOs and just people working for humanity, ‚<U+0080>ù said one of the Danish defendants, Salam Aldeen, the founder of Team Humanity, speaking by telephone after the verdict. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saving lives is not a crime, rescuing people is not a crime.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Mr. Aldeen said he was now eager to return home after nearly two years in Greece ‚<U+0080><U+0094> his pretrial conditions included being barred from leaving the country. He continued working as a rescuer during that time, he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I lost everything but I did not lose my humanity, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. Along with Mr. Aldeen and another Dane, Mohammed el-Abassi, who also worked for Team Humanity, three Spanish firefighters who volunteered for the Spanish group Proem-Aid faced as many as 15 years in prison. The five were arrested on Jan. 14, 2016, just a few hours after successfully rescuing 51 migrants, according to Mr. Aldeen, the owner of the boat on which the five were working. Not long after their operation, the men said, they had alerted the Greek authorities to another migrant boat in trouble, without approaching it. They were arrested soon after. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even see the boat, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Aldeen had contended. The prosecution drew condemnation from some Spanish officials and aid and advocacy groups, including Amnesty International, as Team Humanity and Proem-Aid sought to raise public awareness about the case. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Since when is it a crime to save lives?‚<U+0080>ù Team Humanity‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website asked. Last month, the three Spanish firefighters ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Manuel Blanco, Jos√© Enrique Rodr√≠guez and Julio Latorre ‚<U+0080><U+0094> held a news conference alongside Spain‚<U+0080><U+0099>s foreign minister, Alfonso Dastis, and the volunteers received backing from politicians, particularly in Andalusia, their home region. Before the verdict, Cristina Morata, an official from the city hall of Seville, the capital of Andalusia, said she hoped that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>common sense‚<U+0080>ù would prevail after the men had already waited two years for a ruling. A delegation of politicians from Andalusia traveled to Lesbos to show support for the defendants. Ver√≥nica P√©rez, a Socialist politician who joined the delegation, said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Humanitarian aid should never be condemned or sentenced but instead the opposite: It should be valued.‚<U+0080>ù In Denmark, Team Humanity had raised money to help cover Mr. Aldeen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legal fees, accusing the Greek government of treating him like a criminal for trying to help refugees. Advertisement Mr. Aldeen has been met with great sympathy in Denmark. Yet other well-meaning Danes have similarly faced legal jeopardy. After the 2015 refugee crisis, hundreds of Danes were convicted of human trafficking for offering asylum seekers a meal or a ride from towns near the German border to train stations and ports with connections to Sweden. Mr. Aldeen, the son of an Iraqi father and a Moldovan mother, is himself a former asylum seeker who left Moldova at the age of 9 and grew up in Denmark. He said he traveled to Greece in September 2015 after televised images of a drowned Syrian child, Alan Kurdi, who washed up on Turkish beach, inspired him to help.

The Kurdi family, like thousands of others who made and tried to cross the Aegean, were refugees from the war in Syria. Many, including children like Alan, continue to die. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It changed my life, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Aldeen said, noting that he gave up plans to set up a small construction company and instead founded Team Humanity. His lawyers called the case politically motivated. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I believe the defense we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve put together is rather strong, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Aldeen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Danish lawyer, Christian Dahlager, told Politiken, a Danish daily. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious that from the side of the Greek authorities there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a colossal interest in establishing that it is human trafficking or attempt of trafficking, as it deters others from doing the same, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. The case joined an increasing number in Europe that have placed migrant rescue groups in the legal cross hairs. Italian authorities have searched and sometimes seized rescue boats over the past year, accusing them of abetting human smuggling and illegal immigration. Earlier this year, Italian authorities seized the boat of a Spanish group, Proactiva Open Arms, that had picked up migrants in international waters and took them to Italy, instead of letting Libya‚<U+0080><U+0099>s coast guard take them back to North Africa. Advertisement In recent months, the often rapid intervention of the Libyan Coast Guard when migrant boats ran adrift has complicated the scenario at sea. Aid workers have reported threats, including gunfire that has been aimed at their vessels. At the peak of the refugee crisis in late 2015 and early 2016, thousands of asylum seekers were arriving on the islands of the Aegean from Turkey every day. Lesbos bore the brunt of that influx, prompting volunteers from all over the world to visit the island in a bid to help Greece‚<U+0080><U+0099>s strained coast guard officers. Greek authorities occasionally expressed concern, however, about the difficulty of coordinating with voluntary workers. Arrivals from Turkey have increased in recent weeks with the improved spring weather, though the influx is far smaller than that at the peak of the crisis. Greek authorities are now warning of a new potential crisis at the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s land border with Turkey, where arrivals have increased threefold compared with last year, according to the Greece‚<U+0080><U+0099>s migration minister, Dimitris Vitsas.

Hafthor Julius Bjornsson took a break from playing Gregor Clegane, the brutal warrior known as the Mountain, and won the long-running Worldís Strongest Man competition on Sunday in the Philippines. Bjornsson, 29, has been a regular in the competition and had three second- and three third-place finishes over the years, but had never previously won. ìItís my passion and my dream to become the worldís strongest man,î he said in a 2016 profile in which he shared his workout secrets with The New York Times. ìI would like to win the Worldís Strongest Man competition, as you would win best writer in the world. Is that a title that exists?î Bjornsson certainly qualifies as a figurative Mountain. He checks in at 6-feet-9-inches and 400 pounds. But he is far from the merciless monster he depicts on television. A scene in which he crushed a foeís skull with his bare hands ìactually made my heart hurt,î he said in 2014. The Worldís Strongest competition will be shown in the United States on CBS beginning in June. Among the events Bjornsson contested this year were the Car Deadlift, the Truck Pull and a grueling Loading Race in which he hauled anchors, anvils and other heavy objects. After the victory, Bjornsson posted a photograph of himself lifting the trophy on his Instagram account, adding ìWant to thank all of my family, friends and fans for supporting me along the way.î The Worldís Strongest Man was originally a made-for-TV American-based event in the 1970s, held at Universal Studios in California. The first year included another strongman turned actor, Lou Ferrigno, who played the Incredible Hulk on TV. Ferrigno placed fourth. The event expanded internationally after a few years and is now respected and established with a dedicated core of fans. Iceland did well in the competition in the 1980s and í90s: the musclemen Jon Pall Sigmarsson and Magnus ver Magnusson won 8 contests in 11 years. But no Icelander had won since 1996, until Sunday. Bjornsson had missed out on last yearís title when one of his lifts in the Viking Press competition was disallowed. ìItís frustrating when something is taken that youíve worked hard for,î he said. But he had vowed to be back this year to finally claim the title. ìI could not stop, I would regret it forever,î he said. ìI am 28 years old today and am improving with each year.î"

The island has been hit by hundreds of earthquakes in recent days, including one Friday with a magnitude of 6.9. The Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency also warned about the threat of high levels of deadly sulfur dioxide gas. Last week Hawaii County ordered evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions, where about 1,800 people live. Heath Dalton, a resident of Leilani Estates who was evacuated on Friday, returned to his home on Sunday morning. He drove a truck and trailer, planning to pick up boxes of his familyís possessions that he had packed earlier, but instead found his home engulfed in flames. ìI couldnít go up my road,î he said. ìIt had huge, huge coverage of lava probably close to 10 feet tall.î He drove around to another street, where an inch-wide crack, spewing steam and growing in size, bisected the road. ìI debated, then I just decided to go, so I gunned it,î he said. When he got to his street, he knew his trip had been in vain. He called two neighbors to tell them their houses were gone. ìI look at mine and I can see my house burning,î he said. ìAt that point I called my wife and said thereís no reason for you to come, thereís nothing to get.î Officials said Sunday that 26 homes had been destroyed but they saw that number as likely to grow because the flow of magma was expected to continue. ìThereís no sign of it slowing down,î Talmadge Magno, the civil defense administrator for the County of Hawaii, said Sunday at a news conference. ìWe had some pauses yesterday, but it seems like thereís a lot of magma underground.î He also said the levels of sulfur dioxide were ìstill high.î The Civil Defense Agency said residents of the Leilani subdivision would be allowed back into their neighborhood from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily to check on their property and remove possessions. Lanipuna Gardens was closed, however, because of dangerous volcanic gases, the agency said. Nonresidents were warned to keep away. ìPlease, the residents of Leilani need your help,î the agency said. ìThis is not the time for sightseeing. You can help tremendously by staying out of the area.î Fountains of lava have reached heights of 330 feet, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said. One video posted by the observatory showed orange and black lava belching smoke and flames as it crawled down a residential street. Other images taken by helicopter showed molten rock inching across the subdivision, setting alight the structures it touched. While the property damage is increasing, no deaths or injuries have been reported. Mr. Dalton, who works for Spectrum Cable, said he, his wife, Denise, their 4-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son were unscathed. But their house was a complete loss, and for now they are staying with friends. He expressed frustration at not having been allowed to return earlier to remove items before his house burned. But he praised the support of his community, which has helped displaced families and created online networks that have been the quickest source for detailed information. ìFurniture, clothing, you name it, everything we own is gone,î he said. ìWe have two vehicles. I have my family, and I have my health. It could be worse.î"

Today, the islandís beauty remains, as do signs of what once was.",Neel Mukherjee,T Magazine,US,"Wind, Water, Historic preservation, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Travel;Tourism, Hebrides","IT LOOKS LIKE the Island of the Dead as we approach it, rising like an angled furl of black rock from the steel-gray sea, the dark clouds sitting so low and heavy on its head that one fears theyíre permanently positioned there, like an irremovable and burdensome crown. The journey to St. Kilda has not been easy. First, there were three consecutive days of last-minute boat cancellations as I sat in Portree on the Isle of Skye off the west coast of Scotland, around 250 miles northwest of Edinburgh, waiting for favorable weather conditions. They arrive, as if by magic, on the very last day that I can conceivably remain on the island before heading back home to London. Without that last-minute salvation, I would have had to return next summer to get to St. Kilda, which is another (nearly) hundred miles further west. And the phrase ìfavorable weather conditionsî here means something more obscure than the absence of driving rain. It depends on two things ó ìwind speed,î which is obvious enough once itís pointed out, and ìsea swell,î a surface state of water that dictates whether a boat can make landing at the bay in Hirta, the main island in the small archipelago of St. Kilda. It rains all morning as I take a taxi to Uig, the port from which boats depart to St. Kilda, and increases in intensity for the first three hours of the four-hour ride. The sea is choppy ó the experience of riding it feels as if the boat is often being lifted up several stories high on a billow, then dashed down from that height onto concrete. Who would have thought that hitting water could be so rough? Our skipper, Derek Gordon, smiles coolly throughout, as if this is a leisurely walk in a manicured English garden on a balmy summer evening. The skipperís assistant, also smiling, goes about the boat, distributing ginger candies for those who might need to quell their travel sickness. The route is outlined to us as we make our way out west: across a strait called the Minch into the Sound of Harris, which separates two islands of the Outer Hebrides, North Uist on the left, Harris and Lewis on the right. We are picking up a few more people from a tiny island called Berneray, next to North Uist. Iím sitting right at the front ó a calculation ingrained from childhood, probably misconceived, about distance from the driver and its correlation to motion sickness ó so the dashboard sonar is only a few inches away from my face. On it I can see scores of lines, which, it is explained to me, are records of routes taken by the boat on its previous journeys. Read more: Where to Stay (and What to Eat) in the Scottish Hebrides My sense of perspective, never the sharpest, is now so out of whack that I fail each and every time I scour the map and try to relate its markings to the territories they represent in reality. Is that Pabbay? No, just a rock that has raised its head from under the water temporarily. O.K., surely that hulking landmass to the right must be Harris? No, itís a tiny uninhabited island called Shillay. For significant stretches of the journey, not much can be seen through the water streaming down the windows. The sense of anticipation that we are being led to a place much like Eden, beautiful, pristine, almost impossible or at least very difficult to get to is dampened by the weather: Are we going to see anything through the scrim of rain and the pall of clouds? As we near St. Kilda, the islands look as if theyíre deliquescing. Then the second piece of magic happens: The rain lets up, the low-hanging clouds begin to look, at their lower edges, like plumes of dense smoke, and the black rock of Hirta reveals itself to be the lushest shade of green. ST. KILDA, A Unesco World Heritage site owned by the National Trust for Scotland, is one of the outermost outposts of the British Isles: Beyond it to the west lies the North Atlantic in an unbroken stretch until Newfoundland. The main island, Hirta, was inhabited until 1930. Beyond the reconstructed main village, which is just a row of half a dozen houses, the island is dotted with scores of cleits, stone storage huts with turf roofs, that characterize the St. Kilda archipelago. The surrounding smaller islands of Soay, Dun and Boreray, and the several sea stacks in the straits between the islands, were never peopled, although they were used to graze sheep (soay means ìisland of sheepî in Old Norse) and provided the islanders with seabirds (and their eggs) for food. There are no trees ó what can survive being buffeted by the North Atlantic winds from all sides year-round? ó but the archipelago is the most important breeding site in northwest Europe for nearly a million seabirds each year, including gannets, petrels, puffins, skuas, fulmars, shearwaters and guillemots. Some numbers might assist in imagining the place: Hirta is about 2.5 square miles, but it has the highest sea cliffs in the United Kingdom (Conachair, the highest, is 1,400 feet). It is easy to see what attracted Michael Powell, the British director, to St. Kilda, which inspired his first major film, which he shot when he was 30, ìThe Edge of the Worldî (1937). Powell, born in 1905, is one of the very few great filmmakers that Britain has produced. He began his career assisting directors such as Alexander Korda and Alfred Hitchcock (who would remain his lifelong friend). Hired as a contract director by Kordaís production company, London Films, Powell first met the screenwriter Emeric Pressburger on ìThe Spy in Blackî (1939). They would soon set up a production team called the Archers that lasted until the late 1950s. The Powell-Pressburger partnership produced classics of midcentury British cinema such as ìThe Life and Death of Colonel Blimpî (1943), ìA Matter of Life and Deathî (1946), ìBlack Narcissusî (1947) and ìThe Red Shoesî (1948), among others. Their films are often deeply felt and deeply imbued with a magical sense of place. Filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola have cited Powell as an influence on their artistic careers. ìThe Edge of the World,î which Powell wrote and directed before meeting Pressburger, dramatizes as fiction the real-life events that led to the evacuation of Hirta. In 1928, the entire population of the island, never more than 200, had fallen to 37, half of what it had been eight years before. Disease, malnutrition, isolation, the attrition of daily life, the denuding of the island of peat (the main source of heating), crop failure from salt spray blowing in from the Atlantic ó all contributed to its eventual abandonment. In 1930, the last remaining islanders were evacuated, at their own request, since their old way of life was no longer tenable, and were resettled on the mainland. Shooting a film on a windswept, rain-battered, remote Scottish island (Powell, in fact, did not get permission to film on St. Kilda, so he shot it on Foula, one of the Shetland Islands, about 250 miles northeast, instead) couldnít have been easy. The thought of the transportation of equipment and crew alone to the island makes my head swim. But the story of St. Kildaís evacuation must have made the Hebrides too compelling an idea for Powell. Almost 10 years later, he ventured with Pressburger to the Isle of Mull, a more tractable place in the Inner Hebrides, to film ìI Know Where Iím Going!î ìThe Edge of the Worldî focuses on two families, the Mansons (Peter, the father, and Ruth and Robbie, his adult daughter and son) and the Grays (Andrew and his father, James). A simple oppositional dynamic is set up: All of Robbieís energies are focused on leaving the island and its way of life, which he considers to be dying, for the bigger world (Norway, in this instance), while Andrew, his best friend and also Ruthís fiancÈ, is more ambivalent. Peter Manson remains implacably opposed to his sonís outward-bound ambitions. The two friends take a bet on the subject: Whoever manages to scale the most difficult cliff first, without ropes, gets to have his way about the decision whether to leave or stay. Needless to say, tragedy ensues. All this is over by the first half, or less, of the film. The rest of the film works out the St. Kildan version of one of the oldest stories in the world: the decay of one unsustainable way of life and the surrender to another. But change is the only constant in our sublunary world, as writers down the centuries have noted; Powell, too, knew this well. The islanders were skilled climbers; their lives depended on it since the meat and eggs of seabirds were their main source of protein, and the birds nested and laid their eggs on precipitous and dangerous terrain. People hauled themselves up cliff faces using ropes, often a group of them tied to one another; children were ideal for this task because they were light. Tragedies were not uncommon. Here is Rev. Donald John Gilliesís firsthand account of harvesting guillemots in spring 1918: This bird was found on Boreray, Stac Birroch, near the Island of Soay, [and] Stac an Armin. ... With the method used to catch this bird, you endeavoured to dress as close to the colour of the rock as humanly possible. You selected a ledge and laid on this ledge at night.... This was my first experience at this type of capturing the guillemot and I remember being a little scared. This bird would fly on to this ledge approximately an hour before dawn. If the idea of clinging to a ledge all night on Boreray appears to be daunting, how about this one of Gilliesís father harvesting gannets on Stac Lee, a precipitous sea stack all of six acres in area, near Boreray? Landing on Stac Lee is not a very easy chore, however; the sea requires to be dead calm. There is a pin stuck to a rock and a rope has to be connected to this pin, then if one is successful in getting the rope around the pin, a man can jump to the ledge. This is the only way landing can be made on Stac Lee. In order to catch this bird, itís at night. By the end of the film, both Robbie and his father have fallen to their deaths while climbing the precarious cliffs of Hirta. Peter, who originally opposed Robbieís proposal to leave the island on his own terms at a village meeting, has stubbornly resisted the pressure to make a better, easier life away from the island. When the pressure ultimately becomes impossible to oppose, he relents, but at the last moment, decides to scale a cliff for a guillemot egg that he can sell to a collector. As he climbs, the rope frays and ultimately gives, resulting in the filmís final death, which is heavy with metaphorical weight: The old way of life has to give; itís no longer viable. Despite the palpability of longing in his backward glance at the tough old way of life on the island, Powellís sympathies lie with the newer order: The narrative depicts with economy and dramatic eloquence the ravages to which the islandersí lives were prey. The combination of the breathtaking ó and frequently bleak ó beauty, that splendid and terrifying isolation, and the always already vivid theme of the inevitable death of an old order leading to the emergence of a new, would have proved irresistible to a young filmmaker. You feel that the potential for the visuals alone ó so much shifting, restless drama of wind, sky, water, rock ó could have been the deciding factor. SOME OF THE HOMES in the village on Hirta ó all of one short street ó have been restored, while others are falling into ruins. Behind the village are the most distinctive built structures ó the cleits somewhat resemble igloos and have stone roofs covered with turf, with grass and moss growing on them. These green-topped huts look as if theyíve strayed in from a Germanic fairy tale. They were built to store a whole range of things on which the islanders depended: grains, ropes, salted seabirds, cured fish, peat, seabirdsí eggs. There are some cleits, especially near the village, that look more or less intact ó have they been touched up for tourists? ó but most of them, dotted all over the island (there are about 1,400 on Hirta), are in various stages of ruination, some nothing more than a pile of stones which the grass is claiming in what will be eventually a victorious outcome for the vegetation. I climb the steep slope behind the main village to see what lies on the other side of the hill. It seems like the wettest, boggiest slope ever, with scores of crisscrossing rainwater runnels, turning everything into a churn of mud and sheep droppings. Often the most feasible way of walking from one point to another is not a straight line but a zigzagging, circuitous detour, because we donít want to be mired ankle-deep in mud. I turn back frequently to look at the sweeping curve of the bay, the houses becoming toylike with increasing distance. The stones of the disintegrating cleits begin to look naturally occurring, left by geological events rather than human intervention. The sun comes out and transforms the bay to a blinding mirror. I am led upward by the illusion that once I get to the visible top, thereís going to be another ridge or hill, or at least a gradual decline into the sea. But when I reach my destination, it turns out to be the edge of a cliff between the two hills of Conachair and Oiseval; nothing prepares me for it falling sheer and vertical into the water separating Hirta from Borerary and its stacks. It is dizzying; you have to step back instantly from the edge. The stretch to Boreray is the blue of the sea in a childrenís book. I am two weeks too late for the bird season, but at this distance, without binoculars, I wouldnít have been able to see the teeming colonies of northern gannets. A counterfactual: If the St. Kildans had had more help with communication services, presence of health care personnel on the island and other support with infrastructure, would the island still be inhabited today? The irony is that it is, and has been continuously for the last 60 years: The Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom has had a military base here since 1957. Now operated by the multinational defense contractor QinetiQ, the station is mainly used as a radar-tracking outpost. As the boat nears Village Bay, the only segment of the shore of Hirta conducive to landing, your eyes will reluctantly alight, after the spectacular bigger view, on the smaller detail of squat dark green prefab boxes crowding the harbor. These marring details accumulate. If the clouds lift enough, you will see the radar masts on the top of Mullach Mor. There is a road leading up to the radar station, on which I observe army trucks traveling up and down. Two helicopters land on and take off from a flattened portion just off the beach. There are low piles of construction materials strewn everywhere. It might be said that this blot is localized to one small section of the island near the jetty, although itís the eye-level view as you arrive and the one thatís spread out below as you climb down from one of the cliffs. But notice something: This blemish is artfully left out of most photos of the island, an artfulness you, too, as a visitor struggle to impose on your own pictures of the place. Of the 88 pictures I have from the day, I have been forced to allow some kind of truncated portion of the prefab-littered harbor to peek into a corner of only five pictures; forced because otherwise the bigger scenery could not have been captured. A lot of my photo-taking time there is spent moving my phone up, down and sideways to stop the structures from ruining the view. Is the impulse behind this a kind of purism or a kind of self-deception? After the sheer toil and uncertainty of the journey, and the battle with weather, why would you want to ruin your pictures of a far corner of paradise? For in the end, is this not a kind of collusion, too?"

The proposal has been in discussion for some time by top officials at the Department of Homeland Security as a way to cut the rising number of migrants crossing into the country. Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, sent the order to border agents on Friday, according to two people familiar with the directive. The Washington Post reported last month that it was being considered. Additionally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month announced a new zero-tolerance policy against migrants illegally trying to enter the United States along the southwest Border. Under the directive, undocumented immigrants who are stopped by the Border Patrol or customs officers will be sent directly to a federal court by the United States Marshals Service. Children will be put in the custody of Health and Human Servicesí Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to the two people familiar with the policy, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it had not yet been announced. The adult immigrants would be sent to detention centers to await trial. If convicted, they would be imprisoned for the duration of their sentences, after which they could be returned to their country of origin. The policy is a reversal of sorts from how previous administrations handled prosecutions of undocumented immigrants. In the past, families who were stopped after crossing the border with their children were released into the United States to await civil deportation hearings. However, immigrants seeking asylum still could be protected, the officials said. In cases where migrants who have illegally entered the United States express fear of returning to their home country because of political prosecution or other dangers, Customs and Border Protection officers can refer them to asylum interviews. That process is handled by Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. The department said the new policy responds to increasing illegal migration over the past 12 months, including a significant rise in families and children who are crossing the border alone. The new policy, officials said, is designed to protect young children who have been abused by smugglers or drug trafficking organizations. According to the most recent figures from Customs and Border Protection, at least 50,000 immigrants last month sought to illegally enter the United States, a major uptick in traffic after apprehensions dropped to a 40-year low in 2017."

Before the end of the month, the police arrested two of the men she had named ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Gregory Counts, then 19, and VanDyke Perry, then 21. They were charged with four counts of first-degree rape, three counts of first-degree sodomy, kidnapping and criminal possession of a weapon, according to court records. The third man was never caught. Investigators had no physical evidence connecting the men to the crime or the crime scenes. Semen recovered from the woman, identified in court records as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the complainant, ‚<U+0080>ù did not belong to the accused. The prosecution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case relied solely on her testimony, which was inconsistent, court records show. Defense attorneys argued that the case was poorly investigated, noting that a vehicle in which the complainant said much of the assault occurred was never searched or tested for evidence. The defense argued that the complainant, a recovering crack addict, fabricated the story to protect her boyfriend, who shot Mr. Perry two months earlier and was wanted by the police, court records show. Still, in 1992, a jury convicted Mr. Counts and Mr. Perry on all counts except for the weapons charges. Advertisement Last month, nearly three decades later, the woman told investigators that Mr. Perry and Mr. Counts were innocent and that the rape ‚<U+0080><U+009C>never happened.‚<U+0080>ù The woman recanted her story to investigators with the Manhattan district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Conviction Integrity Program, the Innocence Project and the Office of the Appellate Defender‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Reinvestigation Project. They had begun a collaborative reinvestigation of the case in 2017, a year after DNA testing connected the semen to another man through the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national convicted offender database. By then, Mr. Perry had served nearly 11 years in prison before being released in 2001; Mr. Counts, who was released in August, had served 26 years behind bars. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This case is a tragedy for everyone involved, ‚<U+0080>ù Manhattan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s district attorney, Cyrus R.

Prosecutors and lawyers working on behalf of the convicted men will file a joint motion asking a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan to vacate the convictions and dismiss the original indictments against Mr. Perry and Mr. Counts because of newly discovered DNA evidence and the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s changed story. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This was a particularly dark time in New York City during the crack epidemic, ‚<U+0080>ù said Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit that uses DNA evidence to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At this point in time in New York City, people were scared of teenagers who looked like my clients.‚<U+0080>ù This will be the ninth conviction to be vacated since the creation of the Conviction Integrity Program in Manhattan in 2010. Attorneys for Mr. Perry and Mr. Counts said the case was flawed from the start. When the trial began in 1992, the complainant was issued a warrant forcing her to testify, the joint motion stated. She testified that she lived in a house in Queens with her boyfriend, who was a recovering addict, and their two children. Mr. Perry was dating a teenage girl who lived in the same house, and he eventually moved in, according to court records. The complainant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boyfriend began using drugs again and selling them from her home along with Mr. Perry, Mr. Counts and a third man. But in September 1990, the men assaulted the boyfriend for failing to pay back a debt. Two months later, the complainant said her home was burglarized and told the police she believed it was the three men. Sometime after that incident, the complainant testified that Mr. Perry confronted her boyfriend at their home and that he shot Mr. Perry. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The complainant told a jury that on Jan. 18 she was leaving her home in Queens when Mr. Counts appeared and forced her into a car at knifepoint. Inside the vehicle, she said, were Mr. Perry and the third man, who demanded to know where her boyfriend was. She testified that they brought her to a public housing complex on Amsterdam Avenue and 106th Street, where they believed she was living with the man. But when she refused to tell them where he was, she testified that they drove around and raped her multiple times in the vehicle and in Central Park. Advertisement During the trial, the defense argued that she was not a reliable witness, and that her stories shifted often. She said, for example, that she had been punched in the face so hard that her eyes had swollen, but a doctor who treated her and testified said there was no evidence of such an assault. The doctor also testified that while there were signs of sexual activity there were no signs of sexual trauma. Defense attorneys argued that the complainant had a motive to retaliate against the men and that the boyfriend had good reason to help her out because it meant charges for shooting Mr. Perry could be dropped. Mr. Counts and Mr. Perry spent years fighting their convictions despite a number of failed appeals. While in solitary confinement, Mr. Counts read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Actual Innocence: Five Days to Execution, and Other Dispatches From the Wrongly Convicted‚<U+0080>ù and then wrote to the Innocence Project asking that it conduct a DNA database check of the samples collected in his case, according to Seema Saifee, a senior staff lawyer with the nonprofit. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He never gave up, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. In 2015, the DNA was retested. It matched the profile of a man who had been about 40 years old in 1991 and died in 2011, according to court records. Investigators with the prosecutor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office interviewed the complainant in 2016 with a photo of the person who may have been the attacker, but she told them she did not recognize him. She explained to investigators that she had used drugs at that time and that she would sell herself to support her habit. She refused to talk further. In February, investigators found and interviewed the third man, who denied the rape and explained that the car the complainant said she was attacked in was inoperable at the time, court records show. Investigators returned to the complainant, who this time admitted that the story was a lie. She told investigators that her boyfriend forced her to make the fake accusations and that she had been haunted by what she had done. Mr. Perry moved to the West Coast after he was released, started a family and worked odd jobs to support himself. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to go back to the place where he had been treated so unfairly, ‚<U+0080>ù said Mandy Jaramillo, senior staff lawyer with the Office of the Appellate Defender. Monday will be his first time back in New York City.

Targets Low-Level Gun Offenders",Attorney General Jeff Sessionsís aggressive enforcement has set off a debate about whether his approach is the most effective way to fight gun crimes.,Ali Watkins,U.S.,Domestic Politics,"Gun Control, Guns, Crime, Justice Department, NRA, Jefferson B Sessions III, US Politics, US Attorney","WASHINGTON ó Bobby Amos stood outside of an Episcopal church in Alabama last spring, begging police to kill him. He had been suicidal earlier and held a gun to his head, his wife said, and she had hidden the weapon at the church, where he had followed her to retrieve it. There was little to indicate that Mr. Amos, 39, was a danger to anyone but himself that day. He was arrested unarmed outside the church, in need of treatment and counseling, according to his lawyer, Fred Tiemann. Police recovered the pistol from the building. Federal prosecutors, citing Mr. Amosís conviction of felony robbery as an adult at age 15, instead charged him with illegally possessing a firearm. He pleaded guilty in November and is serving a three-year sentence in federal prison. Urged by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to punish offenders as harshly and as quickly as possible, federal prosecutors have increasingly pursued low-level gun possession cases, according to law enforcement officials and an examination of court records and federal crime statistics. Mr. Amosís conviction was part of the Justice Departmentís broad crackdown on gun violence during the first 15 months of the Trump administration. Mr. Sessions is putting into action his own long-held views on criminal justice, forged as a United States attorney in Alabama during the drug war. They reflect a philosophy popular among conservatives and long backed by the gun lobby: that the effective enforcement of existing laws can reduce crime without resorting to the passage of additional legislation. ìI believe very strongly in enforcing gun laws,î Mr. Sessions said in an interview with the far-right Breitbart News this year. ìI believe thereís no value in having them on the books if theyíre not prosecuted.î Mr. Sessionsís approach has touched off a debate about whether he is making the country safer from violent crime, as he and President Trump have repeatedly vowed to do, or devoting resources to low-level prosecutions that could instead be put toward pursuing bigger targets like gun suppliers. ìItís a good idea to enforce the existing gun laws,î said Avery Gardiner, co-president of The Brady Campaign, a nonprofit coalition that works to combat gun violence. ìThatís something prosecutors should do. But going only after the people who are purchasing the guns illegally is only part of the story.î Local police, who have for years sought more muscle from federal law enforcement, welcomed Mr. Sessionsís more aggressive approach. ìWe have been trying to send a message,î said J. Thomas Manger, president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents police departments across the country. ìThe bad guys have a real fear of federal prosecutions versus state prosecutions.î Penalties for federal gun convictions are steep. On average, firearms defendants spend six years in federal prison. If they are convicted under the two statutes requiring mandatory minimum sentences, that average jumps to 11 years. In the three months following a directive from Mr. Sessions last year to pursue gun crimes, possession cases ó a relatively routine charge ó rose nearly a quarter. That was part of a 15 percent increase in all federal gun prosecutions in the first nine months of 2017. Three out of every four federal gun charges filed in the 12 months starting in October 2016 were under a statute forbidding felons from owning or transporting a gun, according to Syracuse Universityís TRAC database, which monitors gun crime statistics. The period encompasses both the end of the Obama administration and the first several months of Mr. Sessionsís term. Three law enforcement officials described a newfound interest among prosecutors in taking on smaller gun cases ó referred to in law enforcement parlance as one-man, one-gun cases for their narrow impact. Such cases had long been left to state and local prosecutors, freeing Justice Department officials to focus on broader investigations of interstate gun trafficking and criminal networks. On Jan. 1, 2017, police in York, Pa., stopped Steven Gray, 46, whom they said was carrying a pistol. Mr. Gray was charged in federal court last April with illegally possessing the firearm, which he denied was his. A forensic investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found no discernible DNA on the weapon. Mr. Gray, who had a prior felony drug charge, was convicted and faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced in the coming months. ìSometimes it appears theyíre just looking for numbers,î his lawyer, Thomas Thornton, said of federal prosecutors, who denied the accusation. ìOur efforts are not about numbers,î said David Freed, the United States attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. ìWe are focused on reducing violent crime and protecting law-abiding citizens.î But few law enforcement officials want to make a priority of prosecuting low-level offenders, one said, describing simmering concern that the pressure from Mr. Sessions will lead prosecutors to prioritize conviction totals over their impact on crime. When Mr. Tiemann sought leniency for his client, prosecutors pointed to Mr. Sessionsís policy, he said, telling him that they were ìnow required to pursue the most serious charge and the most serious punishment available.î Prosecutors initially sought to charge Mr. Amos with an offense that carried a sentence of up to 15 years before settling on a lesser charge, Mr. Tiemann said. Richard W. Moore, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, which prosecuted the case, said Mr. Amosís conviction record ìspeaks for itself.î ìConsistent with Department of Justice policy, we charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,î said Mr. Moore. Supporters of Mr. Sessionsís initiatives acknowledge the politics of his approach and remain wary it could be used to sap energy from further legislative or regulatory efforts to combat gun violence, like regulating assault weapons or increasing background check requirements. ìWe certainly are hoping for some additional legislative fixes by Congress,î Mr. Manger said. It is difficult to judge the impact of Mr. Sessionsís initiatives. Many offenders charged with federal gun laws in 2017 are just now going to trial or being sentenced, and some of the cases could still be moved out of the federal system. Federal firearm prosecutions have historically ebbed and flowed, often spiking in the years following significant court decisions or large-scale mass shootings. After steadily dropping since 2004, prosecutions began increasing again in 2015, according to the TRAC database. People convicted of firearms-related crimes make up more than 17 percent of the federal prison population, the second-biggest group after drug offenses, Justice Department data showed. Ninety-six percent of defendants convicted of a federal firearms offense in 2017 were sentenced to prison. ìEnforcement isnít always the solution to those different types of crimes,î said Inimai Chettier, director of the justice program at New York Universityís Brennan Center for Justice. ìThe result might be to increase the federal prison population without a correlating reduction in crime.î Amid surging public pressure following the mass shooting at a Florida high school in February, Mr. Trump directed Mr. Sessions to more strictly enforce existing gun laws. Survivors of that shooting have pushed Mr. Trump to ban assault weapons and raise the legal purchasing age for firearms. Instead, prodded by Mr. Trump, Mr. Sessions pushed federal prosecutors to more strictly enforce background check violations and ban bump stocks, a device that can help semiautomatic weapons fire like machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas massacre in October. Mr. Sessions explained his rationale at a speech following the Florida shooting. ìItís not good,î he said, ìif weíve got gun laws that say criminals canít carry guns and they never get enforced.î"

The outcome of Lebanon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first parliamentary elections in nine years shored up Hezbollah‚<U+0080><U+0099>s position in a way that is likely to alarm the United States, Israel and Gulf Arab nations like Saudi Arabia. Iran backs Hezbollah, a political party and militant group that maintains Lebanon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most powerful military force and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. Iran has also invested in allies in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, whose parliamentary elections on Saturday could hand victories to groups aligned with Iran. While the number of seats held by Hezbollah itself remained largely unchanged at around 13, victories by political allies who support its maintenance of a vast arsenal increased the chances the group would play a key role in a coalition government and diminished the prospects for legislation that would challenge its status. Advertisement The election‚<U+0080><U+0099>s biggest blow was to the movement lead by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most prominent Sunni Muslim politician and an ally of the West. His group, the Future Movement, saw its parliamentary share shrink by about one-third, to 21 seats from 33 seats, in the 128-member body, Mr. Hariri told reporters on Monday. In Lebanon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s complex, sect-based political system, the prime minister must be a Sunni, while the speaker of Parliament is a Shiite and the president is a Maronite Christian. While Mr. Hariri‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movement lost ground to rival Sunnis, he still appeared poised to keep his job as prime minister. It remained unclear late Monday when the Lebanese government would release the official results for the poll, which was held on Sunday. That would begin negotiations to form a government, a process that could drag on for weeks or months. Lebanon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unique sectarian make up and place in the region make its politics about local issues like jobs, infrastructure and garbage collection as well as about regional rivalries and alliances. In general, the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s politics have long broken down between a camp affiliated with Iran and one oriented toward Saudi Arabia and the United States. Mr. Hariri, the leader of the latter camp, appears to have lost ground because his supporters were disappointed by his performance and because of the concessions he had to make to rival parties to secure his post as prime minister, said Emile Hokayem, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who was in Lebanon for the vote. The strong showing by Hezbollah and its allies could jeopardize the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s regional and international standing at a time when its leaders are counting on international support to prop up the economy, support the military and deal with the burden of nearly 1 million refugees from neighboring Syria. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lebanon is very exposed to the Iran-centered turmoil in the region, so Hezbollah and the others are going to have to navigate carefully if they want to avoid the consequences of that, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Hokayem said.

Hezbollah‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a televised speech on Monday that the results would give ‚<U+0080><U+009C>protection‚<U+0080>ù to what his supporters call ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the resistance, ‚<U+0080>ù or the regional alliance opposed to Israeli and American influence. Kassem Qassir, a Lebanese political analyst close to Hezbollah, said that the elections represented a victory for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Iranian axis‚<U+0080>ù but that Hezbollah‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leaders would seek to make decisions that were good for the country as a whole. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to control Lebanon, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Qassir said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The country is facing many challenges, and Hezbollah is in need of international and outside support.‚<U+0080>ù Other regional dynamics affected the vote. Mr. Hariri has long been close to Saudi Arabia, although that relationship has been under strain since a bizarre episode last year when he was summoned to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and forced to announce his resignation. While Mr. Hariri appears to have mended his ties to the kingdom and its powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis did not provide generous financial support for his campaign as they have in the past. In recent years, Saudi Arabia and Israel have become increasingly alarmed about Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s growing influence in the Arab world, and they are likely to see further evidence of this in the election results. On Monday, a member of Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s security cabinet said that the Lebanese state had become indistinguishable from Hezbollah, which he said would change Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s calculus should it wage a new war against the militant group. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The State of Israel will not differentiate between the sovereign State of Lebanon and Hezbollah, and will view Lebanon as responsible for any action from within its territory, ‚<U+0080>ù Naftali Bennett, the education minister in Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s conservative coalition government, wrote on Twitter on Monday. Advertisement The Lebanese government reported voter turnout at 49 percent, down from 54 percent the last time legislative elections were held in 2009. In Beirut, home to about half of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s estimated 4.5 million people, turnout was between 32 and 42 percent, depending on the district. While returning many of Lebanon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s power brokers to office, the elections also brought in new faces. An unprecedented number of women candidates ran, and the number in Parliament appeared to rise to seven from four, which is low compared to other states in the region. The campaign also saw the participation of dozens of candidates representing civil society groups who focused on services like water and electricity and criticized the established parties for corruption and their inability to address the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pressing problems. At least one was reported to have won, a female journalist. Also winning a seat was Jamil al-Sayyed, a retired general and former intelligence chief who is a close friend of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria."

The home crowd of nearly 3,000, most in orange and black, the colors of Oregon State, cheered, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Luke! Luke! Luke!‚<U+0080>ù They wanted a victory against Arizona State, one of their biggest rivals. More than that, they wanted a performance that would hark back to a different time ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the time before anyone had heard that Heimlich, 22, their hero, had pleaded guilty to a felony: sexually molesting his 6-year-old niece when he was 15. Otherwise, this game in Goss Stadium seemed completely normal, as has been true all season, which has unfolded in a surprisingly ordinary way. The Beavers are again among the elite. They have a good chance of making it back to the College World Series in June. They might win the national championship. But, given his past, the question remained, why was Heimlich even on the mound? In a series of interviews with The New York Times this weekend, Heimlich flatly denied committing the crime he had admitted to, saying he pleaded guilty to quickly dispense with the case and for the sake of family relations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nothing ever happened, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, when asked for specifics about what might have occurred between him and his niece. His denial is not likely to stop the questions that surround Oregon State and its baseball team. Questions that both Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s critics and his fans have been asking for months. Not just about innocence or guilt. But when, exactly, should one be forgiven for a crime? What form should that forgiveness take? For how long should a conviction of a crime committed as a child, even as a teenager, mark the trajectory of one‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life? Does the type of crime matter? Advertisement And what about the victim? How does her enduring anguish figure into a quest for redemption and a new beginning? Last June, when The Oregonian first reported Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s guilty plea, it said he originally had faced two charges stemming from incidents between 2009 and 2011. The victim is the daughter of one of Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s older brothers. She has not been identified by name. According to court records, the newspaper said, she told investigators that she was in Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bedroom at his home south of Seattle when he pulled her underwear down and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>touched her on both the inside and outside.‚<U+0080>ù The Oregonian quoted the documents as saying, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She told him to stop, but he wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t.‚<U+0080>ù As part of a plea deal, reached when Heimlich was 16, one of the charges was dropped and he was placed on two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> probation, took court-ordered classes and had to register for five years as a Level 1 sex offender, a designation the state of Washington uses for someone considered of low risk to the community and unlikely to become a repeat offender. Heimlich also had to write a letter apologizing to his niece. Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case might never have been made public if not for the fact that, years later, while pitching for Oregon State, he failed to update his whereabouts for a state registry of sex offenders, which led to a police citation, which in turn tipped reporters to his case. Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s court records were sealed last August, two months after the first news stories broke. That month, five years after the date of his plea, he said, the records were expunged. He no longer has to register as a sex offender. The news of the case roiled the Oregon State campus and made national headlines. Heimlich left the baseball team, saying he did not want to be a distraction. Other than a brief statement in which he said he had taken responsibility for his conduct as a teenager, he declined to comment. Now, on Saturday, in the interviews with The Times, he spoke about what he called his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unique situation.‚<U+0080>ù Asked about the critics who have demanded that Oregon State refuse to let him rejoin the team, he was succinct: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have anything to tell them, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They can have their opinions of me. Ultimately the people around me know who I am. That is what matters. Everybody else can say what they want.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement The case, he said, is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a delicate family situation, ‚<U+0080>ù though he declined to go into the details. Did he abuse his niece? Heimlich insisted he did not. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I always denied anything ever happened, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even after I pled guilty, which was a decision me and my parents thought was the best option to move forward as a family. And after that, even when I was going through counseling and treatment, I maintained my innocence the whole time.‚<U+0080>ù There was no interaction with his niece that he could imagine would have been misinterpreted, he said, adding, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nothing ever happened, so there is no incident to look back on.‚<U+0080>ù Although Heimlich has begun to talk about his troubles, the silence around him among Oregon State officials has not cracked. Last year, after Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s guilty plea had been made public, the Oregon State coach, Pat Casey, a two-time national title winner, denied knowing about Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s past while he was recruiting him to come to Corvallis. This season, Casey has said little more than that he supports his star. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a fine young man, ‚<U+0080>ù Casey told reporters last summer, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and for every second that he has been on this campus, on and off the field, he has been a first-class individual ‚<U+0080><U+0094> someone his family should be proud of, our community should be proud of and his team is proud of.‚<U+0080>ù Citing confidentiality laws, university officials have refused to say what they knew about Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s background. Coach Casey and Steve Clark, a university spokesman, would not grant interviews with The Times, nor would the Oregon State president, Ed Ray. (Ray was chairman of the N.C.A.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executive committee in 2012 when it leveled unusually stiff penalties against Penn State over the sexual abuse of children by Jerry Sandusky, a former Nittany Lions football coach.) Ray had issued a statement after the university reviewed the case, saying in part it would ‚<U+0080><U+009C>welcome all educationally qualified students, including those rehabilitated from past crimes.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement In his interviews with The Times, Heimlich said that he had not talked about his case with Casey before his plea went public. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is my job to report to the local law enforcement, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If that didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get conveyed to the university then I would not know, I was not a part of that.‚<U+0080>ù When the initial report about him was published, the immediate question was whether Heimlich would stay on the team, which was advancing in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The victim‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, who also has not been named to protect the identity of her daughter, was quoted by the Oregonian as saying, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m appalled that the college he is going to would even have him on their team.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He got two years of counseling and classes, ‚<U+0080>ù she told the newspaper. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been changed for the rest of her life.‚<U+0080>ù The victim‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother could not be reached for this article.

Ray, the Oregon State president, supported Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voluntary withdrawal from the team last season. He also left the door open for a return. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If Luke wishes to do so, ‚<U+0080>ù he said in a written statement at the time, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I support him continuing his education at Oregon State and rejoining the baseball team.‚<U+0080>ù Heimlich would have turned professional if he could have. More than 1,200 players were chosen in last summer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s major league draft, but Heimlich, who was eligible for selection, was not one of them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> though he had once been projected to be a high pick. So, with the goal still to make the majors, he returned to the Oregon State team this year. He has dominated the mound, but not quite as overwhelmingly as before. Last year his pitches was nearly unhittable: his .076 earned run average was among the lowest in college baseball. This year, though he is 11-1, that number hovers around 3.00. At the time of his decision to plead guilty, Heimlich told The Times, neither he nor his family ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understood the magnitude of the situation.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080>ùWe weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t given the greatest legal advice, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So we weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t properly prepared.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement What about his handwritten apology? He said that he wrote it because he had to. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There were certain requirements when going through counseling that had to be done to finish.‚<U+0080>ù Given a chance to do everything over, would he plead guilty again? ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am not sure, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. Heimlich suggested the idea that his niece would face aggressive questioning in a trial factored into his decision to plead guilty. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Trials aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fun things and, as I said before, it is a delicate situation within a family, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to do anything to complicate things.‚<U+0080>ù Pleading out held the promise that, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>five years from the date, everything would go back to normal.‚<U+0080>ù Still unresolved is what effect the case might have on his future in baseball. Heimlich said he was ready to play in the major leagues. After spending much of this season trying too hard to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>prove people wrong‚<U+0080>ù with his pitching, he said that he is feeling comfortable again, both on the mound and off. He said that he has talked to several major league general managers, even to owners, and that he has been contacted by most of the big league teams. Officials with major-league baseball teams declined to speak on the record about Heimlich. In five years, in 10 years, where will he be? ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I will be playing baseball, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. In Corvallis, where baseball players are treated with the reverence many universities save for football players, Heimlich remains deeply respected among fans. Advertisement At Goss Stadium, as Heimlich pitched in the game against Arizona State, support was obvious. Most fans stood adamantly behind him. Some said they had quit paying attention to the Heimlich story after February, when the university announced a policy some called the Heimlich Rule. It requires recently accepted and continuing students to reveal any felony convictions, or sex offender status. Those with criminal backgrounds will have their admissions reviewed. Others said they had given lengthy consideration to the case and had decided juvenile crimes should be forgiven ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even the most heinous ‚<U+0080><U+0094> once justice, and in some instances prison time, has been served. Still others said the news media should not have written about Heimlich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s past. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was doing everything he was supposed to do, everything the courts asked, ‚<U+0080>ù said Raymond Brooks, a retired Oregon State professor. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why even dig it up?‚<U+0080>ù In the ninth inning of the game against Arizona State, Heimlich was taken off the mound after a sudden string of off-the-mark pitches. He walked toward his teammates with a grimace. The crowd gave him another ovation. That kind of support doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sit well with everyone. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even after all the heightened attention about abuse since last year, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a bubble in Corvallis when it comes to this case, ‚<U+0080>ù said Brenda Tracy, 44, one of Oregon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most prominent victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights activists. A registered nurse, Tracy received national attention in 2014 when she said that she had been raped in the late 1990s by a group that included two members of the Oregon State football team. After going public with her story, she spent time as a consultant for the school on assault prevention and policy. Ray, the Oregon State president, hailed Tracy for her efforts to highlight the problem of on-campus sexual abuse. But he and Tracy don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t agree about Heimlich. Playing sports at any level is a privilege, not a right, Tracy said, and Heimlich should not be on the team. Let him stay in school, she said; let him graduate and move on. But she said she does not think anyone who has pleaded guilty to molestation should be wearing a university sports uniform, or that he should be cheered. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What kind of message does that send our kids?‚<U+0080>ù she asked. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have now normalized this behavior. The feeling at Oregon State right now is that our team is winning, so they‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve moved on. What does that say to the little girl in this case? What does it say to all survivors?‚<U+0080>ù Madeline Gorchels, 24, said that she is a sexual abuse survivor. She said she was molested as a child. She is also is an Oregon State baseball season-ticket holder. Last June, when she heard the news about Heimlich, she said she walked into a closet, crumpled to the floor and shook for hours. But she has found ways to be loyal to Oregon State. When she heard Heimlich had left the team, she traveled to Omaha for the College World Series last year. When he returned to the team this year, she said she felt nauseated. But she shows up for every game she can. She applauds for the offense, but she sits stone quiet when Heimlich pitches. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I feel like it is important to be there to represent my point of view, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even if I am not actively saying something, it is good for me to be there to say that I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think what has happened is right. Part of it is I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want what he did affecting my behavior. But part of it is being there as a witness to the fact that this is wrong.‚<U+0080>ù"

But she will talk about that and other issues affecting children.",Katie Rogers,U.S.,Domestic Politics,"US Politics, White House, Social Media, Children, Laura Bush, Stephanie Clifford;Stormy Daniels, Kellyanne Conway, Michelle Obama, Barron Trump, Donald Trump, Melania Trump","WASHINGTON ó When she unveils her official initiative as first lady on Monday, Melania Trump will follow in the footsteps of other modern first ladies who focused on their passions. Laura Bush championed literacy. Michelle Obama was an advocate for fitness. Mrs. Trump will focus on good behavior on social media as part of a broader initiative that will focus on the overall well-being of children. In recent months Mrs. Trump had backed away from her initial promise to combat cyberbullying after the criticism leveled at her husband for his own brand of online insults. Knowing she would get criticized if she pursued anything related to social media, the president suggested she take an easier path. But Mrs. Trump ultimately decided to make good online behavior a part of something broader. ìThere are too many critical issues facing children today for her to choose just one,î her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in an email about the first ladyís plans. ìShe wants to use her platform as first lady to help as many children as she can.î But like the first lady herself, the full details of the plan are likely to remain mysterious even after they are revealed. She is likely to take up issues she learned about in recent public appearances: She has visited a West Virginia clinic that treats infants born with opioid addiction, and a Michigan school to stress the importance of kindness. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, has been a particular help briefing Mrs. Trump on the opioid crisis, a White House official said. In her brief time at the White House ó Mrs. Trump moved to Washington with her son, Barron, last June ó she took her time establishing her own profile, with only a stilletoed misstep or two ó literally: She piqued the publicís interest by wearing high heels on a trip to an area decimated by a hurricane. But she also drew positive attention for speaking before her husband about a protest in Charlottesville, Va., that left one woman dead. In January, amid news that Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actress known as Stormy Daniels, had accused the presidentís attorney of paying her to stay silent about an affair days before the 2016 election, Mrs. Trump put the brakes on her public appearances. Her office dismissed her absence as a coincidence, while others close to the president said that Mrs. Trump had been surprised and angered by the news reports. In recent months, Mrs. Trump has emerged more often without Mr. Trump by her side. She has twice been seen avoiding or swatting the presidentís hand away during public appearances ó mishaps she has privately dismissed as bad photography angles ó and she is rolling out her platform even as Mr. Trump and his legal team have added new, confusing contours to the story surrounding Ms. Daniels. She has directed her 10-person East Wing staff to stay focused by telling them that the stories swirling about Ms. Daniels are ìjust noise.î The state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, brought a new level of attention to the East Wing, particularly after Mrs. Macron commented that Mrs. Trump was essentially trapped in the White House. ìMelania canít do anything, she canít even open a window in the White House,î Mrs. Macron told the French newspaper Le Monde. ìShe canít put her nose out. Me, every day, Iím out in Paris.î One person close to Mrs. Trump said that, like other modern first ladies, she has chafed against some of the boundaries of living in the White House. B ut, that person said, she has begun to embrace the possibilities of her role, particularly because she has been touched by letters she has received. According to two others who know her, she has adjusted to the role primarily because her 12-year-old-son is happy in Washington. ìSheís a devoted mother,î Hilary Ross, the wife of Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trumpís commerce secretary and a frequent dinner guest of the Trumps, said in an interview. ìAnd if her son is happy, she is happy.î"

Even Republicans ignored them, and Congress then added billions to the very programs he targeted in what seemed a personal rebuke. But Mr. Mulvaney ‚<U+0080><U+0094> President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s exasperated, restless, but deeply determined budget director ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has found an alternative path to relevance in Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Washington. A firebrand fiscal hawk as a congressman from South Carolina, Mr. Mulvaney has seized on his second job as the interim chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an opportunity to dismantle an Obama-era watchdog agency vilified by Republicans since its inception as an example of government overreach. He is making the most of his opportunity, unapologetically attacking the signature accomplishment of one of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most nettlesome enemies, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and taking on the other Democratic legislators outraged by his efforts to gut the bureau. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are lots of targets of opportunity over there for Mick, ‚<U+0080>ù said Marc Short, Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legislative affairs director. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like a mosquito in a nudist colony.‚<U+0080>ù Testifying last month about the bureau before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Mulvaney looked forlorn as he slumped under a whirring national debt clock projected on the wall by committee Republicans, a reminder of his failure to rein in federal spending. Then Democrats started attacking him and he sprung to life like a Jack Russell terrier off leash. Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota struck first, chiding Mr. Mulvaney for installing frosted glass on the glass walls of his office, what he described as a literal effort to subvert ‚<U+0080><U+009C>transparency.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been to your office, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mulvaney shot back. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t see into it.‚<U+0080>ù But Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s intentions at the bureau are anything but opaque. Since taking over in November, he has halted all new investigations, frozen hiring, stopped data collection and proposed cutting off public access to a database of consumer complaints. He dropped most cases against payday lenders ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a primary focus of the consumer bureau ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and also proposed scrapping a new rule that would have heightened scrutiny of an industry accused of trapping vulnerable customers in a cycle of debt. And he has tried hard to persuade Congress to take away funding authority for the bureau from the Federal Reserve ‚<U+0080><U+0094> so that Congress can cut it. Advertisement Mr. Mulvaney insists he has the bandwidth for both the budget and consumer jobs ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and, in a sign of his seriousness, has brought over his top communications adviser from the Office of Management and Budget. But he is an intermittent presence at the bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s headquarters, according to current and former staff members. He works there no more than two or three days a week, a few hours at a time, and seldom on Saturdays, as he initially suggested he would do. Some Republicans question the wisdom of Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s working only part time as the director, whose duties include reviewing major regulations coming out of any federal agency as a federal court deliberates the legality of his running an independent agency like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sure it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to wear those two pretty big and important hats, ‚<U+0080>ù said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think being O.M.B. director is a full-time job; he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s probably spread pretty thin.‚<U+0080>ù At the bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s headquarters near the White House, Mr. Mulvaney has touched off a polite but ferocious civil war, walling himself off behind the new frosted glass walls, while career civil servants, largely excluded from decision making, battle him to preserve the original mission of the agency. Mr. Mulvaney, a hypercompetitive golfer with an 8 handicap, is determined to prevail while maintaining he is strictly adhering to dictates of the law. In his view, that means giving equal weight to reducing ‚<U+0080><U+009C>burdensome regulations‚<U+0080>ù on the industries he regulates, as he described his approach to a meeting of lenders last month. During his April congressional testimony, Mr. Mulvaney said career lawyers were proceeding with about 25 existing cases. But enforcement lawyers said they have been asked to draft extensive memos for the bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new political leadership to justify their work. Some cases have been closed or paused indefinitely, and several current bureau staff members expressed concern that Mr. Mulvaney could soon drop a major case against Navient, the student loan company accused of cheating borrowers. Last month, in what seemed like an unexpected return to the bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Obama-era enforcement, Mr. Mulvaney announced a $1 billion fine against Wells Fargo for well-documented abuses within the bank‚<U+0080><U+0099>s consumer and auto loan divisions. Advertisement But the case was in the works before Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tenure and had the public support of Mr. Trump, who warned in a Twitter post in December of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fines and penalties‚<U+0080>ù against the bank after a news report said that Mr. Mulvaney was considering dropping the case. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m glad that the really devoted public servants at the bureau were allowed to do their jobs this one time, ‚<U+0080>ù Richard Cordray, the Democrat who ran the bureau from its inception in 2011 to last November, when he resigned to run for governor of Ohio, said, referring to the Wells Fargo case. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I guess it would have been embarrassing to let someone get away with doing something this gross.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s move to weaken the bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s consumer protection efforts have prompted some state attorneys general to fill the void. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As it became clear that they were not going to be pursuing these cases and working with us, we picked up the slack, ‚<U+0080>ù said Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Democratic attorney general.

But Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s approach is finding favor with the person who may matter the most: the president. Mr. Trump, several administration aides said, is delighted at the idea of Ms. Warren watching an institution she spent years building being undermined from within ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and eager to see Mr. Mulvaney continue waging a battle to reduce federal regulations through the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Trump was so intent on changing the consumer bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s direction that he planned to fire Mr. Cordray as soon as he became president, but he was talked out of it by advisers. They pointed out that under the statute creating the agency, the president can remove the bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director only for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance, ‚<U+0080>ù and advised that he wait to make a recess appointment. Mr. Trump did not like waiting. At one point last summer, he instructed the White House operator to call Mr. Cordray so he could fire him but was talked down by John F. Kelly, according to two former administration officials. In late November, Mr. Cordray resigned and installed his deputy, Leandra English, as acting director. That set off a scramble within the White House to shove Ms. English aside. The White House, seeking to avoid a new confirmation battle, considered sliding the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, into an interim leadership role. Gary D. Cohn, then the chairman of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s National Economic Council, lobbied for Mr. Mulvaney, his sometimes golf partner. Mr. Mulvaney leapt at the chance, arguing that he would be aggressive in dismantling the bureau, according to an administration official. Democrats have questioned Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s relationships with the industry he is supposed to be policing. At a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, asked Mr. Mulvaney if he had ever ‚<U+0080><U+009C>rubbed elbows with payday C.E.O.s or their lobbyists and lawyers in exotic locations.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Mr. Mulvaney, who took about $63,000 from the payday industry while in Congress, said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the only contact‚<U+0080>ù he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was in the ordinary course of business, ‚<U+0080>ù a response that turned out to be untrue. In February, Mr. Cohn had invited Mr. Mulvaney to a tournament at an exclusive club in the Bahamas. Eating lunch, they were approached by J. Paul Reddam, the founder of CashCall, who told Mr. Mulvaney he wanted to discuss the bureau‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case against the California-based lender over high-cost loans. Mr. Mulvaney responded that he thought all of the payday cases had already been dismissed, but would refer the request to a deputy, according to two people with knowledge of the encounter. The intervention had no apparent effect. Career lawyers at the bureau recently appealed a judge‚<U+0080><U+0099>s order that reduced CashCall‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fine to $10 million from the proposed $287 million. Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s position was that Mr. Reddam was the head of a mortgage company, not a payday lender. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think this administration has a lot of trouble with the truth, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Brown said. Sometimes it is telling too much truth that has gotten Mr. Mulvaney into trouble. Last month, he breezily informed a conference of 1,300 bankers and their lobbyists that he had a standing rule in his congressional office: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talk to you.‚<U+0080>ù His comments annoyed White House officials and prompted calls among Democrats, including Mr. Brown, to investigate whether he had committed a violation of federal Hatch Act pay-to-play rules. But Mr. Mulvaney does not mind making a stir. When reporters posted pictures on Twitter of his aides sipping beers on the balcony of the budget office near the White House last summer, he shrugged off a suggestion to scrap or relocate his Friday office happy hours. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hey, we already took the hit in the media, so let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s keep doing it, ‚<U+0080>ù he told a colleague at the time. Advertisement During a pre-inauguration tour of the offices, Mr. Mulvaney skipped policy questions and instead asked about the gym and whether there was a place to sleep in his office. When they got to the White House mess hall, he was unimpressed with the tacos, telling his predecessor, Shaun Donovan, the meal did not measure up to the Mexican restaurants he once owned in Charlotte, N.C., according to a person to whom Mr. Donovan related the encounter. Mr. Mulvaney has not wielded much power over the budget and played a back-seat role in budget negotiations. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, did not consider him a central player, aides said. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who leads a powerful appropriations subcommittee, recently told a friend that Mr. Mulvaney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s proposed cuts were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>absurd‚<U+0080>ù and proved he was not a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>serious‚<U+0080>ù negotiator, according to a Republican official with knowledge of the exchange. Still, he has not given up ‚<U+0080><U+0094> he has been prodding Mr. Trump to demand a symbolic $20 billion to $30 billion in cuts to social programs and the State Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s foreign aid budget, according to an administration official with knowledge of his plans. Mr. Trump plans to send a letter to Congress this week asking to cut a fraction of that amount ‚<U+0080><U+0094> $11 billion. Mr. Mulvaney seems happiest when describing new ways to undermine the consumer bureau by, say, removing its online complaint system from public view ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or using the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obscure statutory name, the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, ‚<U+0080>ù to undo years of branding. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The reading of the statute actually revealed some very fun things, ‚<U+0080>ù an excited Mr. Mulvaney told his friendly audience of bankers last week. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>C.F.P.B. doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t exist! C.F.P.B. has never existed!‚<U+0080>ù"

Broadly, the Supreme Judicial Court said in its 44-page ruling, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there is no duty to prevent another from committing suicide.‚<U+0080>ù There may be special relationships where this duty exists, the court said, but for universities, that duty applies only in limited circumstances, such as when its employees know of a student‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expressly stated plans to commit suicide. Universities ‚<U+0080><U+009C>are not responsible for monitoring and controlling all aspects of their students‚<U+0080><U+0099> lives, ‚<U+0080>ù the court wrote, and there is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>universal recognition‚<U+0080>ù that the age of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in loco parentis, ‚<U+0080>ù where universities stand in for parents, is long over. Advertisement The ruling will bring relief to institutions of higher education. A group of 18 Massachusetts colleges and universities, including Harvard, Amherst, Smith and Boston University, had filed a brief supporting the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the lawsuit brought by the student‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family. While M.I.T. has had an unusually high rate of student suicides, the problem affects universities across the country, with an estimated 1,100 college students a year taking their own lives, according to court documents. Preventing them from doing so has become increasingly complex, universities say, in part because of expanded student expectations of privacy and autonomy. Courts generally have been reluctant to rule that faculty and administrators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who are rarely clinically trained in suicide prevention ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are responsible if students end up killing themselves. In this case, the student, Han Nguyen, was 25 and a Ph.D. candidate at M.I.T.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Sloan School of Management when he jumped to his death from a campus building. His family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers said in court papers that they believed that M.I.T., two of its professors and a dean of student life were legally bound to care for Mr. Nguyen and to prevent the suicide. They even suggested that one of the professors, Birger Wernerfelt, had caused it, noting that Mr. Nguyen had leapt to his death just moments after the professor had harshly criticized him.

Lawyers for the student‚<U+0080><U+0099>s father said that M.I.T. was well aware of Mr. Nguyen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fragile mental state, noting that Professor Wernerfelt had even taken steps to ease the stress on the student because he did not want the institute to have ‚<U+0080><U+009C>blood on its hands.‚<U+0080>ù Lawyers for the family also said that M.I.T.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s student support services were inadequate and that while some campuses ‚<U+0080><U+0094> notably, the University of Illinois ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had long ago put in place programs that reduced the rate of suicides, the rate at M.I.T. remained disturbingly high. M.I.T. argued that Mr. Nguyen had been dealing with mental health issues long before he came to M.I.T., including two previous suicide attempts, and that while at M.I.T. he received care from nine different mental health professionals ‚<U+0080><U+0094> none of whom had any affiliation with the university and none of whom deemed him at ‚<U+0080><U+009C>imminent risk‚<U+0080>ù of killing himself. Moreover, the university said, Mr. Nguyen ‚<U+0080><U+009C>repeatedly declined to avail himself of support resources M.I.T. offered.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Nguyen had written in an email to the university that he wanted to keep his mental problems separate from his academic issues. Advertisement M.I.T. said that if the court sided with the family, it would ‚<U+0080><U+009C>transform the relationship between faculty and their students.‚<U+0080>ù The 18 universities that filed a brief on behalf of M.I.T. warned that requiring nonclinical faculty to prevent potential suicides could have disastrous effects. Professors, in seeking to protect themselves from liability, they said, might go overboard in monitoring students, which could drive students underground and dissuade them from talking to anyone about their problems. In its ruling Monday, the high court affirmed a lower court‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision. It noted that the university could do little when Mr. Nguyen repeatedly refused offers of help. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In these circumstances, as a matter of law, a twenty-five-year-old graduate student‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights to privacy, autonomy, and self-determination were properly respected, ‚<U+0080>ù the court wrote. The court also exonerated the professor who warned that M.I.T. could have ‚<U+0080><U+009C>blood on its hands.‚<U+0080>ù The judges said the remark was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>stated metaphorically‚<U+0080>ù and in a different context, not based on explicit statements by Mr. Nguyen that he intended to take his life."

Struggles to Deliver New Subway Cars and Signals,"As the M.T.A. promises big fixes for the subway, two key projects to add new trains and signals are significantly delayed.",Emma G. Fitzsimmons,N.Y. / Region,US,"Subway, Public Transit, Delays, Bombardier, MTA, Riders Alliance, Andy Byford, NYC","An order of 300 new subway cars should have arrived in New York City by January 2017, months before the system was officially declared to be in crisis. Instead, only 32 of those cars are now on the tracks. The order is at least two years behind schedule. The new subway cars may not have averted the current emergency, but they sure could have helped. Deploying some of the oldest trains in the world, the subway has been plagued by an increase in breakdowns. In an effort to save the subway, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are promising ambitious plans that will cost billions of dollars. But two key projects ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the train order and a plan to modernize the signals on the No. 7 line ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are significantly behind schedule. Advertisement The delays raise a central question: How can subway officials tackle a soup to nuts overhaul of the system when they cannot finish what they have already started? Any hope that subway riders will see better service in the near future will depend on sweeping changes at an agency that is not known for its nimbleness. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The M.T.A. doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have to do it two or three times faster ‚<U+0080><U+0094> they have to do it five or 10 times faster in order to stick to a timeline that would make a noticeable difference in people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lives, ‚<U+0080>ù said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. Instead, the authority has a reputation for finishing projects late and far over budget. The latest embarrassment came last month when the authority acknowledged that a project to build a new train station deep beneath Grand Central Terminal will now cost over $11 billion and will not open until 2022 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about 13 years past the original estimate. The delayed subway cars, known as R-179s, are being built by Bombardier, a Canadian company that so poorly managed the contract that it was blocked from winning a different order for as many as 1,612 subway cars that could be worth nearly $4 billion. The $740 million contract for the R-179s, which was awarded in 2012, has had problems, including malfunctioning door lights. Bombardier must produce one car each day to meet its current promise to deliver all of the subway trains by early next year. At the same time, a plan to install modern signals on the No. 7 line, which connects Manhattan to densely populated neighborhoods in Queens, appears to be delayed again, until the end of this year. The signal work by Thales, a French company, has already taken more than seven years and is at least two years overdue. The No. 7 line would be the second route to have its signals modernized under a timetable that would not see all of the system‚<U+0080><U+0099>s signals updated for almost 50 years and that officials are striving to accelerate. The L line, which runs between Manhattan and Brooklyn, was the first to receive the new signal system, which is known as communications-based train control, or C.B.T.C. Advertisement The subway‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new leader, Andy Byford, said he has spoken frequently with executives from the two companies involved in the overdue projects ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mario P√©loquin at Thales and Benoit Brossoit at Bombardier ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and had stressed the urgency of finishing the work. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They‚<U+0080><U+0099>re both on my speed dial, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Byford said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m all over both projects.‚<U+0080>ù The two projects promise to bring some relief to frustrated riders, though more comprehensive overhauls are still years away. The new signals on the No. 7 line will allow two or three additional trains to run each hour, reducing wait times and alleviating overcrowding. The new subway cars should break down less frequently, improving reliability. But with software problems plaguing the new signal system, Thales wants to push back the completion date. The signals were supposed to be installed by April 2016 under a $588 million contract the company won in 2010. Queens residents who live along the No. 7 line have grown exasperated over recurring station closings necessary for the work. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Byford said he would push for the signals to be finished in the next few months. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They may be saying the end of 2018 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m saying no, this summer, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Byford said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m insisting they get to the bottom of these software problems.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. P√©loquin, president of Thales‚<U+0080><U+0099> transportation business in the U.S., said he would work with the transit agency to determine whether the project could be finished earlier. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is our goal to deliver a safe system which everyone can be proud of and provides better reliability and on-time performance, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. P√©loquin said in a statement. The transit agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most important task now is to regain its credibility so that the public believes it is capable of pulling off a rescue plan, Mr. Raskin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We know that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible to modernize a transit system much more quickly because it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happened in other places, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Raskin said, pointing to London, where the subway is older than New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and officials have upgraded the signals far more rapidly. Mr. Byford, who cut his teeth on the transit systems in London and Toronto, plans to release a comprehensive plan to modernize the subway this month. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the authority and is running for re-election this year, has pressed him to upgrade all of the subway signals in under a decade, though Mr. Cuomo has touted a new technology that has not been used on a major transit system. Advertisement As for the setbacks on the subway car order and signal work, Mr. Byford blamed the suppliers for failing to meet their deadlines. He is eager to set a new tone. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t turn the clock back, but I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m determined going forward that we will deliver on our promises, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Byford said. The first R-179 cars started to appear on New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s subway in January. But four months later, with only 32 cars, there are just four, eight-car trains running on the J and Z lines. An additional 21 cars are still being tested. Bombardier plans to deliver all of the cars by the first quarter of 2019, according to Maryanne Roberts, a spokeswoman for the company. The workers at their factory in Plattsburgh, N.Y., about 300 miles north of the city, are working to finish the cars ‚<U+0080><U+009C>as quickly as possible while maintaining the highest standards of quality, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Roberts said in a statement. The oldest subway cars, known as R-32s, arrived in the 1960s. They break down more frequently than other cars and should have been retired years ago. While newer cars can travel nearly 500,000 miles between failures, the R-32s go only about 33,000 miles between failures. Andrew Albert, an M.T.A. board member who represents riders, said the system desperately needs the new Bombardier cars as soon as possible. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way past time, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Albert said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Subway cars are not meant to be kept this long.‚<U+0080>ù"

For the next few hours, Bundervoet would be Buffalo Ben, the official team mascot for K.A.A. Gent, a top Belgian soccer team. As the players warmed up before kickoff at a recent home match, Bundervoet smiled and waved a flag bearing the teamís logo, the profile of a Native American, which is also plastered around the Ghelamco Arena. Scenes like this play out every weekend across Europe, where teams big and small and across a variety of sports employ Native American names, symbols and concepts of wildly variable authenticity in their branding. Thereís the hockey team in the Czech Republic that performs a yearly sage-burning ritual on the ice, the rugby team in England whose fans wear headdresses and face paint, the German football team called the Redskins and many more. For years, these teams were insulated from the vigorous discussion about the use of this type of imagery by sports teams in the United States, where critics long ago deemed the practice offensive and anachronistic. This year, the Cleveland Indians announced that they would stop using their Chief Wahoo logo on their uniforms beginning in 2019, continuing a decades-long trend in which thousands of such references have disappeared from the American sports landscape. During that same period, though, new examples were appearing in Europe, where teams and fans have long viewed the mascots and logos through kaleidoscopes of local culture and, detached from the charged history that the imagery carries in the North America, formed their own ideas about what is socially acceptable. But these ideas are slowly being challenged, and increasingly these teams are finding themselves being asked to confront the same questions of representation, appropriation and stereotyping. K.A.A. Gent, for example, devotes a lengthy page on its website to the history of its logo and nickname, but notes only that the club is ìaware of the public debate in American society around the use of stereotypical images and caricatures.î K.A.A. Gent declined to make any officials available to discuss the topic, and when it learned a New York Times reporter had arranged an interview with Bundervoet, the club intervened and canceled it. ìAmericans, Canadians, theyíre working on this issue, talking about it, debating,î said Stephanie Pratt, a cultural ambassador for the Crow Creek South Dakota Sioux and longtime resident of Exeter, England. ìEuropeans are late to the table. Theyíre just beginning to debate it ó or maybe not at all.î Pratt has found herself in the middle of one such debate involving the Exeter Chiefs, the defending champions of Englandís rugby union league. Exeter, which rebranded itself as the Chiefs in 1999, calls its team store the Trading Post and its online fan group the Tribe. Fans chat on a message board named Pow-Wow. Among the 15 bars at the teamís home stadium are Wigwam, Cheyenne, Apache, Mohawk, Tomahawk, Buffalo and Bison. Just inside the main entrance to the arena stands the teamís Five Nations Totem Pole, memorializing the five countries visiting Exeter for the 2015 Rugby World Cup (not, as some might guess, the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy.) Two years ago, Rachel Herrmann, a historian of early American history at Cardiff University, wrote a blog post criticizing the team after noticing ìa bunch of people dressed up as Indiansî on a train platform one afternoon and learning that they were fans of the club. Herrmannís essay ìPlaying Indian: Exeter Rugby in a Postcolonial Ageî was eventually picked up by a local reporter, Ed Oldfield of Devon Live, who reached out to Pratt for her rare perspective as a person who could speak as a member of both the Native American and Exeter communities. The articles sparked a robust local conversation that soon received coverage in the national news media. Herrmann, who began receiving hate mail around that time, said she was disappointed that the conversation devolved into an argument ìabout whether Exeter fans were racistî rather than ìthe more interesting question of how a country with such a clearly imperial history has incorporated these mascots.î The Chiefs for the past two years have made no public statements about the discussion and declined several requests for comment from The New York Times. ìWe have ëno commentí to make and do not want to engage in any article on this subject,î a team spokesman wrote in an email message last week. Pratt has been to one Chiefs game. She saw the mascot (a costumed character named Big Chief), heard the fansí war chants and watched them do the ìtomahawk chopî and decided never to return. She said such behavior reduced almost 600 distinct tribes into a single clumsy caricature based on 19th-century stereotypes. ìThereís a learning curve for people in Europe, but it needs to be done,î Pratt said. In other cases, American Indian references reflect a deep fascination with the culture in some parts of the continent. HC Plzen, a hockey team in Pilsen, Czech Republic, rebranded with an American Indian logo and mascot in 2009. The Czech Republic is one of the many countries in Europe where the novels of the 19th-century German writer Karl May, who wrote adventure stories about the American West that depicted Indians as noble savages, were wildly popular and hugely influential in shaping the European public consciousness of Native Americans. (May, whose books have sold more than 100 million copies, never set foot in North America.) Lucie Muzikova, a spokeswoman for HC Plzen, said the clubís logo ó the profile of a Red Indian wearing a white headdress ó was designed in part as a nod to the insignia of the United States Armyís Second Infantry Division, which liberated Pilsen near the end of World War II. As part of its in-game presentation, HC Plzen employs the help of West Park, a nearby museum with a 19th-century American West theme. At the start of each season, performers from West Park, who are not of American Indian descent, conduct a public sage-burning ceremony, traditionally seen as a cleansing ritual, inside the teamís arena. Before every game, the performers play drums and carry out a purifying ritual as the players skate onto the ice amid a swirl of smoke, lights and music. ìWe perform everything the way the Natives are doing it and with deep respect,î Petra Michlova, a marketing manager and show team member at West Park, said. Acknowledging that some teams might have only good intentions, Paul Chaat Smith, a Comanche writer and a curator at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, nevertheless said that he felt ìdressing up as Indians is pretty much always a mistake.î ìPretty much everybody agrees youíre just not going to name a team after an entire ethnic group,î Smith added. ìNobody would do that anymore, so the question is, why is it O.K. to keep it? Those general ideas about whatís appropriate would apply to European teams, too.î But many clubs in Europe have only recently been forced to ponder that question. Buffalo Ben, the mascot for K.A.A. Gent, was introduced in 2001 and existed seemingly free of criticism until 2016. That year, De Standaard, a daily newspaper, published a wide-ranging interview with Suzan Harjo, a member of the Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee Indian nations and longtime advocate for Indian rights in the United States. At one point, the interviewer informed Harjo about K.A.A. Gent and Buffalo Ben, noting the mascot was a white man wearing stereotypical Indian regalia. Pointing to studies about the potential harm such mascots can inflict on the self-esteem of American Indian youth, and noting that sports today exist on an international stage, Harjo encouraged the team to alter its branding. The exchange gained broader notice in the Belgian news media, inspiring a quick flurry of columns and leading the team to create the page on its website explaining the history of its nickname and logo, which it said dates to a visit to Ghent more than a century ago by Buffalo Billís Wild West, a touring circus-style cowboy show. An Indian chief first appeared on a K.A.A. Gent flag in 1924. Small adjustments were made. The name of Buffalo Benís occasional female companion, Squaw Mel, was changed to Buffalo Mel, and the team added a new page on its site explaining the ìgigantic social challengesî facing Indians in the United States. But nothing else changed. In the teamís view, the context of its use of the logo and mascot was entirely different from the situation in the United States. In declining several requests to discuss the use of Native American imagery, K.A.A. Gent expressed a desire to avoid another debate about its branding. It referred a reporter to the information on its website. But in a brief phone call in response to follow-up questions posed to the club, Wim Beelaert, coordinator of the K.A.A. Gent Foundation, explained the organizationís point of view that while such logos may indeed be offensive in the United States, they are not so in Belgium. ìWe donít have a historic debt toward the Native American community,î he said. ìWe donít have a natural debt toward the Native American community. And I think these two things are different in the United States. Thatís what we mean when we say we are working in a different historical and cultural context.î In an interview in April, Harjo, who spent five years of her youth living in Naples, Italy, brushed aside the idea that context mattered. ìIím not speaking as an American or as a European,î she said. ìIím commenting on American behavior and European behavior, both of which objectify native peoples. This is consistent for more than 500 years now.î Harjo said there was no right way to use an Indian as a sports mascot because it puts her people ìright there with the animals and the nonhuman beings.î At least one team in Europe has acknowledged the movement and made changes: Two years ago, the Streatham Redskins, Englandís oldest ice hockey club, announced that they would look for a new nickname after determining that theirs, which was introduced in 1974, did not reflect the organizationís values. Fans of the club eventually voted to adopt the RedHawks. But most other clubs have no interest, at least for now, in doing the same. The Frolunda Indians, a professional hockey team from Gothenburg, Sweden, was known as Vastra Frolunda IF until 1995, around the time that the Swedish Hockey League began encouraging its clubs to adopt American-style nicknames. Inspired by the Chicago Blackhawks and the fact that the team in the 1960s was said to play in a ìvilda vastern,î or Wild West, style, it chose the Indians. The club developed a cartoon logo depicting an Indian chief with a headdress fanned around his stern face, and for a time the teamís costumed mascot was a Native American hockey player with a missing tooth and feathers poking through his helmet. (These days, the teamís in-stadium mascot is an anthropomorphic bison.) In 2015, a man in Sweden filed two separate official reports to the Equality Ombudsman, a government agency that addresses discrimination, accusing the team of spreading a stereotypical image of Native Americans. ìI want Sweden to show that you do not tolerate insulting the culture of others,î he wrote, according to the copy of the complaint provided to The Times by the agency. The club dismissed his concerns, and the Equality Ombudsman ultimately rejected the claim. ìWe, from a distance, follow the discussions about the Washington Redskins, the Cleveland Indians,î said Peter Pettersson Kymmer, a Frolunda team spokesman. ìBut we sincerely think that our Indian, in our point of view, is in no way offensive to the Native Americans. On the contrary, itís a tribute, and weíre proud to wear it.î"

The gunmen, described by officials as bandits, entered the village of Gwaska, a rural community in Kaduna State, at around 2:30 p.m., killing indiscriminately before armed vigilantes drove them off. According to local residents, the nearest state police force, based far from the remote village, arrived hours after the killings had ended. Attacks in northern and central Nigeria have left more than 1,500 people dead this year, according to human rights groups, undermining President Muhammadu Buhari, who was elected in 2015 on a vow to improve stability and security. Instead, conditions have deteriorated, but despite serious health problems, growing criticism and calls for him to step down, Mr. Buhari, 75, announced last month that he planned to run for a second term. The country has been plagued by gangs of armed bandits preying on villagers, clashes between herdsmen and farmers and the continuing Islamist insurgency of Boko Haram. Witnesses described the attack on Saturday as the worst in the area in years. The village of mostly farmers, potters and herders is surrounded by thick forest, and it borders a national park that has been a haven for bandit groups that are accused of kidnappings, armed robbery and stealing livestock from isolated communities like Gwaska. Austin Iwar, the police commissioner in Kaduna, said the killings were part of a reprisal attack, after armed vigilantes who protect the village had attacked the bandits in their hide-outs. ìOver the years there have been problems between these bandits and the vigilantes who consistently try to prevent these bandits from operating,î Mr. Iwar said. ìTwo weeks back, the vigilantes attacked the bandits in the thick of the forest, but because it happened in the forest we only learned of this recently.î According to Mr. Iwar, the police had released 200 mobile units to increase security in areas vulnerable to banditry. On Monday, the presidentís office released a statement describing the attacks as regrettable and promising added security, including more troops and police officers for the area. Mass killings by armed herdsmen, amid clashes with farming communities in the central-belt region of Nigeria, have claimed the lives of hundreds of people. The government had increased security in affected states, but the military spokesman, Gen. John Agim, admitted last month that there was no military presence in Benue, the state most affected by the clashes. Chidi Odinkalu, a human rights activist in Abuja, said there had been a significant collapse of security in Nigeria. ìThe governmentís response in these killings in Kaduna, as in Benue, as in all these affected regions, has been to deploy soldiers,î he said. ìBut the military is stretched already so it is making other security challenges worse.î Moreover, officials are not trying to understand or resolve ìthe root causes of the problems,î he added. Mr. Odinkalu said that the killings by bandits could only happen because of government failings. ìBanditry occurs in ungoverned territory,î he said. ìItís in these rural areas with little or no cover. The territory is completely exposed, so at the heart of the issue is a crisis of governance.î Mr. Buhari came to power promising to end the Boko Haram insurgency, which has left more than 20,000 dead, and millions displaced and in need of humanitarian aid. He and the military have repeatedly claimed to have defeated the terrorist group, but it has stepped up its attacks this year, killing hundreds of people at mosques, markets and other gathering places. Last week, at least 27 people were killed when a suicide bombing ripped through a mosque and market area in Adamawa State. In February, Boko Haram militants kidnapped 110 schoolgirls from Dapchi Town, though they returned 104 of the girls less than a month later; five other girls died, and they continued to hold one, Leah Sheribu, a Christian who refused to convert to Islam."

Foremost, how to verify whether Pyongyang has truly shut down facilities long hidden from international monitors. Inspections would be far more difficult than those in Iran under a deal that Mr. Trump wants to end. He argues that Iran made false declarations about its nuclear program, undercutting the accord. Above, an inspection team at a uranium enrichment plant in Iran in 2014. Iran and Israel are both lobbying hard as he nears a decision whether to withdraw from the agreement. The uncertainty has sent oil prices soaring. Advertisement _____ ‚<U+0080>¢ President Trump accused federal investigators of deliberately prolonging the special counsel inquiry to influence congressional elections in November, and he appeared to warn that some involved had conflicts of interest that would be revealed soon. The veiled threat came as the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legal team appears to be struggling to present a consistent message to the public and as Republican fears grow over the possibility of losing control of Congress. In a signal of just how alarmed Republicans are, Mr. Trump also intervened in the West Virginia Republican primary, pleading with voters to oppose a controversial candidate for Senate, warning that if he were chosen, it would lead to a repeat of the party‚<U+0080><U+0099>s embarrassing loss last year in Alabama. _____ ‚<U+0080>¢ What does it feel like to live in a city on the brink of falling to the Taliban?

He found weary and fearful residents who say they can hardly tell anymore who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s in charge. The sense of defenselessness highlights the failures of a U.S.-led war in its 16th year and the struggles of building a democracy in the midst of bloody conflict.

So its sale, just before national elections, to a Malaysian investor with ties to Cambodia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s strongman prime minister, Hun Sen, is stirring fears that the country is sliding toward outright authoritarianism. Above, the newspaper‚<U+0080><U+0099>s printing presses in Phnom Penh in February. The new owner, Sivakumar S. Ganapathy, made his mark felt almost immediately. Several senior editors resigned or were fired after they refused to remove a story from the paper‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website about the relationship between Mr. Sivakumar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s P.R. firm and Mr. Sen, the longest-ruling leader in Asia.

North, who became a household name in the 1980s for his role in the Iran-contra scandal, will become the next president of the National Rifle Association, the gun rights organization said on Monday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Oliver North is a legendary warrior for American freedom, a gifted communicator and skilled leader. In these times, I can think of no one better suited to serve as our President, ‚<U+0080>ù Wayne LaPierre, the organization‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief executive, said in a statement. Mr. North, 74, a former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel and aide to President Ronald Reagan, said he would take the helm of the organization in a few weeks. He will succeed Pete Brownell, who was elected last year and announced Monday morning that he would not seek election to a second term. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I appreciate the board initiating a process that affords me a few weeks to set my affairs in order, and I am eager to hit the ground running as the new NRA President, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. North said in the statement. Advertisement Mr. North emerged in 1986 as a central figure in the Iran-contra affair, in which the Reagan administration used the proceeds from the secret sale of arms to Iran to aid rebel forces in Nicaragua. The nationally televised testimony Mr. North provided to Congress the following year transfixed the nation. In 1989, Mr. North was convicted of destroying government documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. He successfully fought those convictions, getting them reversed in 1991 after prosecutors concluded they could not prove that the witnesses who testified against him weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t influenced by his congressional testimony, for which he was granted immunity.

Mr. North was one of the first political figures to address the crowd at the annual meeting, leading thousands of N.R.A. members in an unapologetically patriotic and Christian opening invocation. The prayer received enthusiastic applause in the arena. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lord, we ask you to deliver us from our enemies, for your forgiveness for those things that we have done and that which we failed to do, when we stray from your word, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. North said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We beseech you for godly, enlightened leaders.‚<U+0080>ù Manny Fernandez contributed reporting."

Mr. Madsen will appeal the life sentence a court imposed on him ó a rare penalty in Denmark, even in murder cases ó but he will not challenge the verdict delivered on April 25 that he was guilty of sexually assaulting and killing Kim Wall, and desecrating her body. ìThe appeal case will only concern the sentencing, and not the issue of guilt,î the Copenhagen District prosecutorís office wrote on Twitter. Peter Madsenís lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said in a text message that the move was ìcertainly no recognitionî of guilt. Even with a life sentence, Mr. Madsen could be considered for release in as little as 12 years. Ms. Wall, 30, who was Swedish, was last seen alive on Aug. 10, when she boarded the vessel, planning to interview Mr. Madsen, 47. Mr. Madsen, who had designed submarines and founded a company to build spacecraft, sank the sub and was rescued the next day. Ms. Wallís torso later washed up on a beach south of Copenhagen, while other body parts were found by police divers. Mr. Madsen admitted to dismembering Ms. Wallís body, but insisted that she had died in an accident, though his accounts changed repeatedly. But evidence presented at trial showed that he had planned the killing in detail ó even discussing it with people ó but had struggled to find a victim; three other women had declined his invitations. ìIt was not premeditated against Kim Wall, but against the next women who wanted to go along with him on the submarine,î the prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said after the verdict. Ms. Wall was a successful freelance journalist who had reported from far-flung parts of the globe for a number of publications, including The New York Times. Paradoxically, she died a violent death not in some distant, dangerous place, but in one of the safest societies in the world, about 45 minutes from where she grew up. Her death, and the investigation and trial of Mr. Madsen, drew worldwide media attention. On the night of her disappearance, Ms. Wall was set to host her own farewell party, as she and her boyfriend were days away from moving to Beijing. Her family, friends and international organizations have established grants and awards in her name."

Then an Officer Pulled a Gun on Him.,An off-duty officer in Southern California thought Jose Arreola was stealing a $1.19 roll of mints and pulled out his handgun.,Matthew Haag,U.S.,US,"Buena Park,, Police Brutality;Police Misconduct;Police Shootings,","Jose Arreola walked into a Southern California gas station to buy Mentos on a Friday night in March and still canít shake off what happened next. After he paid for the mints and placed them in his left jacket pocket, an off-duty police officer behind him pulled out his handgun, pointed it at his feet and accused him of stealing them. ìIt made me angry,î Mr. Arreola, 49, said on Monday. ìI felt this fear and thought of my wife. My wife might become a widow tonight.î The night started when Mr. Arreola, who was on his way to a club with his wife, pulled into a Chevron station in Buena Park in Orange County, Calif. He got $60 out of an A.T.M., then remembered that his wife had asked for mints. Standing in front of the cashier, Mr. Arreola scanned a row of candy bars, sweets and gum before reaching for a roll of Mentos. ìHow much are these?î Mr. Arreola asked the man behind the counter. The cashier told him they were $1.19. The transaction on March 16, which was recorded by the gas stationís security camera, was entirely uneventful until the off-duty officer, who works for the Buena Park Police Department, entered the store. He missed the part when Mr. Arreola handed over $20 for the Mentos. ìHey, put that back,î the officer said as he lifted his sweatshirt and pulled a handgun from his waistband. ìPut it back. Police officer.î ìI just paid for this,î Mr. Arreola responded. The misunderstanding was resolved in about 35 seconds ó the officer put away his gun and apologized ó but it was long enough to taint Mr. Arreolaís perception of the police and to land the officer in an internal investigation. ìYou canít help but look at all these Facebook videos of cops doing bad things,î said Mr. Arreola, who went public with his story on Friday in an interview with The Orange County Register. ìThe way he cocked his gun, I thought he was going to shoot me if I did any wrong move.î Mr. Arreola said that after the encounter, he filed a complaint with the Police Department against the officer, who has not been identified. The department offered last week to settle the dispute, Mr. Arreola said, but he declined the deal because the amount would have only covered his legal fees. Across the United States, police departments have come under intense scrutiny in recent years over the use of force and treatment of minorities. The worst actions by police officers are sometimes captured on cellphone video and quickly shared on social media, fueling a distrust toward law enforcement. John DeCarlo, a former police chief and an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven, said that he reminds police officers to treat everyone they encounter with respect, from mundane interactions to very intense ones. Everyday encounters, like seeing an officer in a gas station, shape peopleís overall perceptions of the police, he said. ìWe have an innate fear of police to begin with,î Mr. DeCarlo said. ìItís about treating people how you want to be treated.î Mr. DeCarlo was startled as he watched the security footage of the off-duty Buena Park police officer. ìOh my goodness,î he said as he watched the officer retrieve his gun. ìHoly mackerel.î He said that the officer violated the most basic rules governing the use of force by the police. No matter the situation, officers should issue verbal commands first. Pulling out a gun should be a last resort. ìWhat the officer did was incredibly inappropriate,î he said. Corey S. Sianez, the Buena Park police chief, said that he was also troubled by the officerís actions. ìI want you to know that after I watched the video I found it to be disturbing, as Iím sure it was to you,î he said Friday on Facebook. Chief Sianez said that the actions by the officer were under review. He did not respond to an email on Monday asking whether the officer was still on active duty or if he had been placed on leave during the investigation. ìI can definitely assure you that our investigation will be thorough,î he said. ìIf the officer is found to be in violation of any policies and procedures, he will be held accountable.î Michael Scott, a former police officer who teaches criminal justice at Arizona State University, said the encounter was troubling on many levels. The officer, who was wearing athletic clothes, was not easily identifiable as the police, and he pulled out his gun and accused Mr. Arreola of stealing before he knew whether a crime had been committed. ìI can sympathize with a young officerís instincts to want to intervene off duty in what he perceives to be a crime,î Mr. Scott said. ìBut good judgment, combined with restrictive policies and training in those policies, are needed precisely to prevent the problems depicted in this incident.î"

But for her sophomore outing, Mrs. Prada decided to take advantage of the presence of pretty much everyone she could ever want in her audience pretty much all needing to be in the same place at the same time ó plus the fact that she had to be there herself anyway to host a table at the gala ó to unveil her collection in New York. Smart, right? It was like a pre-party for the party. A mini-gala in Prada mode. A Pradala. But thatís kind of her thing (the smarts). If Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior has positioned herself as the feministís creative director, Mrs. Prada has always been the thinking womanís designer ó treated backstage like some sort of political philosopher queen of the industry, mobs of journalists hanging on her every musing, esteemed guests whispering hosannas in her ear. So this time íround she invited everyone into the equivalent of her New York home: the cavernous old piano factory in the Far West 50s that serves as Prada HQ, where one floor had been turned into a concrete catwalk designed by the architecture firm Herzog and De Meuron, which redesigned the building when Prada bought it. The windows were lined with sheets of translucent red and blue acrylic, transforming the city below into a piece of Pop Art, and the runway was lined with a mash-up of starry names, including the film director Ava DuVernay; the author Zadie Smith; the actresses Sarah Paulson and ChloÎ Sevigny; the designers Raf Simons and Marc Jacobs; Jessica Morgan, director of the Dia Art Foundation; and Sheena Wagstaff of the Metís new Modern and contemporary art department. Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte, wearing matching dresses in different colors, said it was only the second fashion show they had ever attended that wasnít their own (the first was Chanel). The ability to mix unexpected ingredients into a compelling whole is something of a Prada signature, and it was as true for the collection as it was for the audience: long, narrow silk chiffon skirts were belted at the hips under plain black T-shirt sweaters; polo shirts paired with ruffled leather miniskirts or transformed into empire-waist gowns; brocade trouser suits with knit í70s tees. And all of it was jiggered up with bejeweled thigh-highs, Bakelite logo necklaces, clunky square-heeled loafers, and enormous brocade ushanka hats ó a little bit geeky, a little bit athleisure, a little bit soignÈe; altogether cool. In other words, classic Prada with a contemporary edge. ìItís like my fantasy of reality,î Mrs. Prada said afterward, which sums it up pretty well. There was as much Prada being modeled by the guests as by the actual models, part of the point of the Cruise shindigs, suggesting that the clothes are not as hard to wear as they sometimes initially appear. The actresses Tracee Ellis Ross and Lily Collins were in neon traffic-cone dresses from the February fall collection, the former a hot pink strapless synthetic plastic bubble; the latter a spangled Watteau tea dress under a highlighter orange bustier. ìWhen my mother saw it, she said, ëAt least no car will miss you when you are crossing the street,íî Ms. Collins had said to a friend in the elevator. Mrs. Prada sat on a bench chatting with guests while cocktails were served. ìI love the hats!î said the actor Ansel Elgort, kneeling before her. The hats, Mrs. Prada said, were inspired by a trip to Russia that one of her sons ó a philosopher/racecar driver ó had taken. It was suggested that this was a pretty pointed choice of headgear to pick for a show in New York when the whole issue of Russia, and Russian influence on the last American presidential election, had been much in the news. Had Mrs. Prada, who famously took part in political demonstrations while wearing Yves Saint Laurent, thought about that? Mrs. Prada laughed and waved her hand in dismissal. Then she stood, and was swallowed up by the chattering mob."

More than 10,000 pages from two aides who handled Mr. Pruittís daily schedule offer a detailed window into the extraordinary efforts by his team to keep the public and news media at a distance. Here are some examples. When Mr. Pruitt was scheduled in December to appear with an Iowa cattle rancher, aides at the E.P.A. intervened to make sure that the administrator would not face unfriendly or unexpected questions from the crowd or uninvited reporters. ìItís invite only press I thought?î one aide to Mr. Pruitt wrote. ìMy sincere apologies for causing any difficulty but we cannot do open q&a from the crowd,î a second aide wrote. Planning for a trip to Missouri hit a bump last April when word leaked about Mr. Pruitt meeting with electric utility executives even though organizers had tried to keep the talks secret. ìCatís out of the bag,î one of the organizers wrote. A plan had already been devised to scrub social media about the visit. ìComments that are derogatory and/or abusive will be hidden from public view,î a public relations consultant wrote. ìCommenter receives no notification this hiding has happened.î Mr. Pruitt frequently met with energy industry lobbyists at hotels and restaurants. In one message, an aide revealed that Mr. Pruitt had a particular fondness for Le Diplomate, a French bistro in Washington where the administrator was often seen last year. ìLe Diplomate is his favorite!î one of Mr. Pruittís aides wrote for the planned dinner with a lobbyist, Michael McKenna, who has represented Koch Industries, the industrial conglomerate owned by the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch; as well as Southern Co., an electric utility; and Dow Chemical Co. But there was a problem. ìLe Diplomate is booked so let me see what other options we have. Michael, any Suggestions?î ìCentral. Rural Society. Rosa Mexicano if Mexican is a good answer. Cava on 8th Street, SE. The Hamilton. Woodward Table,î Mr. McKenna wrote back, referring to other popular spots in Washington. When Mr. Pruitt was invited to speak in March 2017 to a group of 250 electric utility executives in a ballroom at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington, he talked about his fast moves to roll back rules intended to protect drinking water and curb climate change. ìWhoever said you canít have your cake and eat it too, doesnít know what to do with cake,î he told them, according to prepared remarks. He added, ìThe future ainít what it used to be.î A visit to a Toyota car manufacturing plant in Texas by Mr. Pruitt came with an upfront demand by the E.P.A.: ìWeíd ask you keep this a private event, closed to press.î As the August event was getting underway, a CBS News reporter heard about it. ìWe just received an inquiry from a CBS News reporter in Dallas about the visitî the Toyota executive told the E.P.A. ìWe wonít reply until the visit is over.î In another instance not previously made public, Richard Smotkin, a longtime supporter of Mr. Pruittís who was a Comcast lobbyist at the time, invited Mr. Pruitt to a fund-raiser for a nonprofit group that he helps run, the American Council of Young Political Leaders, which offers foreign-exchange programs for emerging political leaders. At the event, Mr. Pruitt was to be presented with an award in the form of a globe engraved with his name. Some agency ethics officials raised questions about the appropriateness of receiving an award at a fund-raising event. Officials ultimately came up with a creative solution. ìHere is the feedback I received: ìYes, the Administrator may attend the event, and yes, he may receive the globe,î an email from an aide to Mr. Pruitt, Sydney Hupp, said. ìBut please do ensure that they refer to him as the Honorable (as opposed to the EPA Administrator).î The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort in Naples, Fla., was the venue for a gathering in April 2017 of the National Mining Association, where Mr. Pruitt was invited to a ìClosed ó No press at meetingî event with ìC.E.O.s from the major coal, metal and minerals, as well as manufacturers of mining equipment,î companies, the documents show. The emails include detailed itineraries for Mr. Pruittís travels in June in Italy, with an agenda that shows most of his time was sightseeing. The excursions included a private tour the Vatican library, a private tour of the excavations below Saint Peterís Basilica and meals at top restaurants like Al Ceppo and La Terrazza at Hotel Eden, both in Rome. One of the few work-related events on the schedule was a meeting with Italian-based executives from Dupont, Chemours and other chemical companies. One complication this trip caused: Industry officials in Washington were still making appeals to meet with Mr. Pruitt, in closed-door gatherings. ìThe Administrator will be in Italy next week!î Ms. Hupp, who was a scheduler for Mr. Pruitt, wrote to an executive at Arch Coal, who had requested a meeting with Mr. Pruitt. ìWish that we could make it work!î Lisa Friedman and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting."

The flora tells the melancholy story.",Mireya Navarro,Travel,Domestic Politics,"Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria, Travel;Tourism, San Juan Puerto Rico, El Yunque Puerto Rico","Last November, with Puerto Rico thrown into chaos after Hurricane Maria, I was frantically trying to reach a funeral home in San Juan. My dear cousin Alma Otero-PÈrez, a free-spirited poet who was my mentor and model growing up on the island, had died overnight at her home for patients with Alzheimerís. I loved her and the loss pained me, but as her guardian, I needed to focus on medical and legal paperwork and making the necessary funeral arrangements from New York. I had a relationship with the reliable funeral home that had guided my family through another emotional passage when my mother died several years ago. I called, but the telephones were still out months after Maria had struck. I tried emailing from their website not expecting much. But within minutes they responded by cellphone and in no time my cousinís ashes were prepared and waiting for my arrival and a proper memorial. That gathering didnít happen until months later, in early March, as I waited for a semblance of normalcy to return to the island. Some of Almaís friends and relatives had lost electricity and even running water. Others had joined the exodus, leaving the island to wait out the rough aftermath of the disaster. But even by the time I made it to the island more than five months since Maria, I found that the place where I was born and raised, and that I visit every year with my husband, Jim, was laboring to reestablish its balance. (Last week it erupted in a massive march against new austerity measures that was marred by violence.) With the fresh eyes of newcomers, Jim and I marveled at what everybody else already took for granted ó the damaged traffic lights, dangling and dark; the giant street signs lying mangled on the side of the road; the nonworking streetlights that left whole neighborhoods pitch black after dusk. ìI canít believe the hurricane was in September and Puerto Rico still looks like this,î my husband said as he maneuvered our rented car through a busy honor-system intersection under a traffic light hanging useless from its crossbar. But nothing held my attention more than the vegetation. The ebullient tropical flora that forever feeds the nostalgia of those of us who leave for good ó a paradise of flower beds in backyards and brilliant green forests on mountainsides, the skyline of towering fruit and palm trees ó was in a state of distress, almost a kind of paralyzed melancholy, not unlike some of the people. Just like a pair of cousins who seemed to have revved up their drinking, or my sister Mari, who refused to be out at night, a Cinderella by 6 p.m., the familiar foliage showed new stress-induced idiosyncrasies even amid signs of resilience. ìOh my God ó what happened to the mango tree?î I asked Mari the morning after I arrived at our family home, when, in the light of day, I noticed a massive stump across the street where there had been a wildly productive 25-foot-tall mango factory. ìThe trees were left without a single leaf,î she said of the day after the hurricane. ìIt was shocking. They cut it down.î The mango tree had been a landmark of sorts on Lorenzo Noa Street in El Comandante, the suburb of San Juan where I grew up. Its branches seemed to grow more gigantic over the decades, threatening to smother the houses around it. Its abundant fruit attracted mice. But its sweet mangoes ó small and round, the perfect snack ó were coveted by neighbors and even those who lived blocks away. People stopped their cars to pick up the mangoes that had dropped on the front yard and sidewalk. My own diabetic mother crossed the street often in her older years to satisfy her sweet tooth, cheating on my sisterís strict dietary controls and leaving the evidence in the trash can (five pits was her record.) All that was left of the tree now was a Michelangelo-like sculpture with missing limbs. Our own backyard was in even sorrier upheaval, untouched since Maria as my sister waited for the verdict of an insurance adjuster. One of two coconut trees lay flat across what had once been my momís meticulously groomed garden, a piece of chain-link fence crushed underneath. The tree under which we interred her ashes, a button mangrove, survived somehow, but it was now surrounded by debris blown in from around the neighborhood, including a sign from Famous Daveís, a barbecue restaurant a mile away. The hurricane uprooted so many trees that visitors to El Yunque, Puerto Ricoís famous rain forest, were now treated to newly opened vistas of the ocean. We visited on a Sunday morning and found most of the national park closed, still ailing from landslides and wobbly trees that park workers told us were still falling and shutting down trails and roads. Other trees were dry rather than lush, stripped bare and just starting to revive, or misshapen, with missing branches and a phantasmagoric look. In this haunted forest, what was still available became more precious. Major tourist draws like La Mina waterfall and the Yocahu Tower, with panoramic views of the rain forest and coast, were out of reach. But a small group of tourists gathered by the side of a road took selfies at La Coca Falls, where the waters tumble 85 feet onto a rock formation. Souvenir shops along the way were open. And more visitors found the Angelito Trailhead leading to a river and a swimming hole that was inaccessible because a bridge had washed away. A few intrepid tourists, speaking English, Spanish and Mandarin, crawled their way over some stones to get across. My cousin Ednita, back from a stay with her daughter in Texas, told the only happy story I heard. True, her home in San Juan suffered major roof damage and was quickly taken over by termites. But her first-floor beach apartment in a modern development in Vega Baja, to the west of San Juan, was unscathed and now, for the moment, had an ocean view of sorts, since Maria had carved out a triangle-shaped opening between the once dense sea grape trees she could see from her living room. ìI can see the waves,î Ednita said, blowing kisses in their direction. It was only fitting that we held Almaís memorial gathering in this upbeat apartment near the water, and not just because everybody elseís homes were in mid-repair. In her poetry, Alma had written prolifically about Puerto Ricoís natural beauty. For two hours, more than a dozen close friends and family transported ourselves to her idealized world, reading verses, reminiscing and telling funny stories. ìHallelujah to the land where I was born,î one of her poems, titled ìSong to my Land,î reads. ìHoly land, motherland. Each morning, on the wings of a thousand birds, You kiss the day.î Before I left New York City, I had wondered if my cousin was among the more than 1,000 estimated hurricane-related deaths. But the home where she lived had a generator and had only asked for bottled water and an extra $80 a month for hurricane-related expenses. The immediate cause of death was listed as ìcardiac arrhythmiaî on her death certificate, with other contributing conditions. Josie, the friend who saw her the morning after she died, reassured us at the memorial: ìShe looked at peace, like an angel.î My cousinís advanced Alzheimerís spared her from the collective suffering after the hurricane, which afflicted many of her loved ones. Geka, a lifelong friend, reported she still had no power or running water in the mountainous town of Orocovis, in the middle of the island. She said she had adapted with a generator, a newly built cistern and bottled water. Maritza, a cousin from the town of Juncos, still lived under a blue tarp from FEMA that increasingly leaked. ìYou canít find the panels to fix the roof,î she said. The conversation at the memorial inevitably turned to the hardships of coping, still too present for anyone to relax. A three- to four-month wait for hurricane shutters. The high price of generators. A rise in crime. Deadly traffic. The lack of power for thousands of households and the intermittent power outages for millions more. (Fun fact: you can create a washing machine by making holes in a plunger and plunging away.) I was about to cook lunch one day when San Juan and surrounding areas were hit by a blackout. Two power stations shut down when a transmission line failed, underscoring the continued instability of the power distribution system. I later went to San Patricio Plaza Mall, where some stores remained open with generators but many operated in semidarkness or had closed for the day. The movie theater was dark, screenings of ìBlack Pantherî canceled. But the food court, where the mallís generators powered numerous electrical outlets, was packed with people who had brought their own power bars and extension cords to charge laptops and other electronic devices. The mall had welcomed the electricity-starved crowds after the hurricane, a security guard explained, and since then it had become the place to go whenever the lights went out. More than seven hours later, after I had brought takeout food home for dinner, the power was back. The next day in Old San Juan, which looked like its lovely self, minus countless trees, the owner of CafÈ Puerto Rico, on the edge of Plaza ColÛn at the entrance to the old city, said the outages deterred customers, already so sparse since the hurricane, he said, that he no longer opens the second floor of his restaurant. Puerto Rico is in comeback mode on many fronts, including cruise ship tourism, but ìthe recovery has been too slow,î the cafe owner, HÈctor And˙jar, said. ìThe government wasnít prepared for something so big.î So, people wait ó for more tourists, for hurricane shutters, for consistent power, for building materials, for a better normal. My sister is still waiting for her insurance company to start fixing up the backyard. We then plan to have another gathering to plant a tree with Almaís ashes next to my momís. When one day that tree shows off its plumage, it will honor her love of country ó la tierra ó and help make her beloved Puerto Rico as splendorous as she once remembered it.

Kramer,World,International,"Politics, Inauguration, Vladimir Putin, Russia","MOSCOW ó Vladimir V. Putin took the oath of office on Monday for a fourth term as Russiaís president, in a ceremony staged in a gilded Kremlin hall and replete with pageantry that highlighted his vast accumulation of authority after nearly two decades in power. Mr. Putin, a former KGB agent, has ruled Russia as prime minister or president for more than 18 years, and in that time has crafted an image as a steely nerved leader and the man best qualified to rebuild his country after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a theatrical touch, a televised ceremony began on Monday with Mr. Putin sitting at his desk in the Kremlin, suit jacket looped over his chair, as if hard at work until moments before the ceremony. A phone rang, letting him know it was time for his fourth term; he donned his jacked and walked alone through the red-carpeted Kremlin corridors and into a hall packed with about 6,000 invited, cheering guests. In a short speech, Mr. Putin suggested his focus had now turned to domestic matters and improving Russiaís economy for the ìwell-being of every family,î though there were no words of reconciliation in the countryís tense relations with the West. ìThe security and defense capabilities of the country are reliably supported,î Mr. Putin told the audience of government ministers, lawmakers, religious leaders and celebrities. ìNow we will use all the possibilities we have first of all for the resolution of internal, and most essential, tasks of development,î he said. ìA new quality of life, well-being, security and health for the people, that is what is important today.î Mr. Putin won re-election in March with nearly 77 percent of the vote, the largest margin for any post-Soviet leader. It was a result his backers said showed widespread support, but one his critics dismissed as illustrating the stifling of any real opposition. Abroad, Mr. Putin has sought to restore Russiaís sway in world affairs. During his third term as president, he intervened militarily in Ukraine and Syria, putting him at loggerheads with the West. And, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, he directed Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election to aid Donald J. Trump. At home, he has presided over the restitution to power of the security agency he once served, with many high officials and corporate executives now former officers like Mr. Putin. But the domestic economy has continued to lag, only recently emerging from a painful recession. He has also clamped down on critics, arresting scores of opposition activists and restricting the media. ìThe symbolic Putin is omnipotent, like St. George slaying the Western dragon, but the flesh-and-bones Putin is barely capable of solving Russiansí everyday problems or preventing tragedies,î Andrei Kolesnikov, an associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in a commentary on Mr. Putinís continued popularity despite the economic slump. ìThe president answers for the symbolic renaissance of feelings of belonging to a great world power, while it is mayors, regional heads, and ministers who answer for fires and rubbish dumps.î European election observers with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe wrote that his recent re-election, ìtook place in an overly controlled legal and political environment marked by continued pressure on critical voices.î Underscoring that point, two days before the inauguration, the police arrested about 1,600 people at protest actions called ìHe is not our czar.î Demonstrators wore paper crowns to mock Mr. Putinís long rule, now running longer than any Russian leader since Stalin. The arrests added images of swinging nightsticks and shoving matches with the police to the inaugural events. ìA Spoiled Party,î read a headline on Monday in Vedomosti, a business newspaper. The violence included a seeming throwback to an era of crowd-control tactics in Russia. Men wearing Cossack uniforms and carrying a type of traditional leather whip known as a nagaika had mingled in the crowd, occasionally lashing out. The Echo of Moscow radio station reported Monday that the Cossack group had won municipal contracts to train for and help with crowd control, though it remained unclear whether they acted in an official capacity on Saturday. Mr. Putin first became president on Dec. 31, 1999, when Boris Yeltsin, ailing from heart troubles, resigned. Mr. Putin was then elected in 2000 and served twice, the constitutional limit for successive terms. He then became prime minister for one term, before returning to the presidency in 2012. For his third and now fourth spells as president, the term was extended to six years from four. While not short on pomp, the ceremony on Monday was less elaborate than his inauguration in 2012. In 2012, the police cordoned off much of the city center to allow Mr. Putinís motorcade to glide through quiet streets toward the Kremlin. Eerie images of the leader in an empty city sparked criticism that Mr. Putin had lost touch with the people. This year, he stayed within the Kremlin grounds. He walked from his office to a motorcade that drove from one Kremlin building to another, escorted by motorcycles. In the ceremony, Mr. Putin strode through several interlinked, gilded and chandeliered halls in an historical Kremlin palace before arriving at the Andreyevsky Hall, where guests waited. Few foreign dignitaries attended. Among those in the hall were Gerhard Schrˆder, the former German chancellor and longtime supporter of Mr. Putin. Dozhd, an opposition television station, cited Kremlin officials saying they sought a lower-key ceremony this time. While not exactly calling it routine, Mr. Putinís spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters that the inauguration was less significant this year because Mr. Putin was just beginning a new term, not shifting from the prime ministerís office to the presidency."

He also said that the president might invoke the Fifth Amendment rather than testify in the special counselís investigation. Mr. Trump said as recently as Friday that he wanted to be interviewed by Robert Muellerís team. ï Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, has long been a champion of law enforcement efforts, but that stance has changed. ìThereís no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,î Mr. Giuliani said of the Mueller inquiry. ìVery embarrassing to my former Justice Department.î ï President Trump has said he will decide by Saturday whether to withdraw from the Obama-era nuclear agreement, and Iran and Israel are both trying to influence his thinking. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran warned on Sunday of ìhistoric regretî if the U.S. were to rip up the deal, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called ìfatally flawed.î ï Mr. Trump has argued that the accord has been undercut by Iranís false claims about the status of its nuclear program. Questions about the verification and inspection process could be even more complicated in North Korea, with which Mr. Trump is soon expected to discuss disarmament. ï After two hurricanes last summer, the island all but slipped from the modern era.

Then, as now, there was heightened interest across the Atlantic, and The Times had a front-page photograph and article. Our coverage included descriptions of the crowds who waited to see the couple on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, tales of royal weddings that did not go smoothly and a look at the myriad gifts from near and far. More than a dozen short items covered the details of the day, including tiara trouble and a bomb scare. We also had drawings of the guests and the clothes, including a going-away hat shaped ìlike a soufflÈ.î And finally, a television piece marveled at the BBCís coverage and noted, ìThanks to videotape and jet airplanes, pictures of live quality were shown on North American screens only six to seven hours after the event had occurred in London.î Ultimately, the story ended sadly.

Being a librarian would mean getting paid to read books. Being a veterinarian would mean getting paid to love animals. Was there a job where people got paid to walk around in the woods? I would probably find out in college. Iím not sure how I got this idea of myself as a professional woman. I was a child of the small-town South of the early í60s, and all the women I knew stayed home with their children, whether they cared to or not. (This was true of white women, I should say; the African-American women of my Alabama childhood were mostly working in the homes of white women who didnít work at all.) I also expected to get married and have children. Of course I would; thatís what little girls did. I would finish high school and then college. I would go to work and get married and have a baby. The baby ó and someday that babyís siblings ó would be the crowning glory of it all. I would love my work, but my work would be merely something I did, not something I was. What I would be was a mother. Itís not such a retro idea when you grow up in a family like mine. My mother chafed mightily at stay-at-home motherhood, but I asked her once what she felt she had been born to be, and without hesitation she said, ìI was born to be a mother.î My father felt the same way about being a father. Everything my parents did, they did to support the family. We children were their role in the world. So how surprising is it that I grew up believing that everything in my own life was only a preparation for the day my first child was born, a circle I was drawing that would not be closed until the last child arrived. It did not occur to me that each of my imagined babies, the ones who represented the completion of my life, was born to draw a different circle. In the Venn diagram of their circles and mine, the overlap was barely an instant. The second my own circle was complete, it was already cracking open. Motherís Day, with its hothouse flowers and its restaurant brunches, is only a visible manifestation of the persistent cultural belief that motherhood is the climax of female life. A man who is not a father is assigned no special designation at all, but a woman without children is too often thoughtlessly called ìchildless,î as though sheís lacking something, as though she is diminished, incomplete. But God help the woman who believes this message too wholeheartedly, who feels too acutely that motherhood truly defines her. The very culture that insists that raising a child is the single most important thing a woman can do with her life also maintains that she must be willing to surrender that identity the instant her child leaves home. The notorious ìhelicopter parent,î the meddling mother, the critical mother-in-law ó these are all tropes at least as pervasive and unchallenged as any Madonna and Child image of manifest womanhood. A mother who canít ìlet goî is a grasping, desperate creature, entirely to be pitied if not openly reviled. Laments about helicopter parents who canít let go are missing the point for rank-and-file moms like me. How many of us really have time to micromanage a kidís life when the kid is no longer a kid? Even if I had the time, I wouldnít be tempted: The oldest of my three sons is fully on his own, and my other two, now in college, manage their affairs perfectly well themselves. Their lives, I know, will inevitably include me less and less. It wasnít always this way. When the house my grandparents lived in burned down during the Depression, the whole family moved in with my great-grandparents. When my other great-grandmother became widowed, she joined them in the farmhouse. No one questioned the wisdom of this arrangement or suspected any of them of being emotionally stunted, unable to let go. They simply expected to spend the rest of their lives together, sitting on the porch in the cool of the evening, talking to one another. I love the symmetry of a life like that, love the idea of Sunday dinner after church, the whole family gathered around one big farmhouse table, but Iím also grateful to live in my own time and place. And I have always been too busy to feel sad when my children passed into new stages of competence and independence, even knowing that very independence would one day take them away from me. But I struggle with the constant reminders that my sons share their lives primarily with people Iíve never met, that they all do work I know only in its broadest outlines. They love me; I know that. They call often to chat, and they donít hesitate to ask for advice if theyíre unsure of something. But exactly as their own culture demands, they have also created lives in which my husband and I are on the margins. Peripheral. Almost obsolete. Even a house fire would not send them back to live with us forever. I will love having them all home for Motherís Day, but in one tiny little corner of my mind I will also be missing the days when they were still so small and so needy, when the family circle was still close and closed. I will miss the smell of their sweaty little-boy necks and the feel of their damp fingers clutching my blouse as I bounced them on my hip. And I will remember all the years when Motherís Day meant crayoned cards and plaster-of-Paris handprints and weedy bouquets made of clover and henbit and creeping Charlie and dandelion. The most beautiful flowers in all the world."

Hafthor Julius Bjornsson took a break from playing Gregor Clegane, the brutal warrior known as the Mountain, and won the long-running Worldís Strongest Man competition on Sunday in the Philippines. Bjornsson, 29, has been a regular in the competition and had three second- and three third-place finishes over the years, but had never previously won. ìItís my passion and my dream to become the worldís strongest man,î he said in a 2016 profile in which he shared his workout secrets with The New York Times. ìI would like to win the Worldís Strongest Man competition, as you would win best writer in the world. Is that a title that exists?î Bjornsson certainly qualifies as a figurative Mountain. He checks in at 6-feet-9-inches and 400 pounds. But he is far from the merciless monster he depicts on television. A scene in which he crushed a foeís skull with his bare hands ìactually made my heart hurt,î he said in 2014. The Worldís Strongest competition will be shown in the United States on CBS beginning in June. Among the events Bjornsson contested this year were the Car Deadlift, the Truck Pull and a grueling Loading Race in which he hauled anchors, anvils and other heavy objects. After the victory, Bjornsson posted a photograph of himself lifting the trophy on his Instagram account, adding ìWant to thank all of my family, friends and fans for supporting me along the way.î The Worldís Strongest Man was originally a made-for-TV American-based event in the 1970s, held at Universal Studios in California. The first year included another strongman turned actor, Lou Ferrigno, who played the Incredible Hulk on TV. Ferrigno placed fourth. The event expanded internationally after a few years and is now respected and established with a dedicated core of fans. Iceland did well in the competition in the 1980s and í90s: the musclemen Jon Pall Sigmarsson and Magnus ver Magnusson won 8 contests in 11 years. But no Icelander had won since 1996, until Sunday. Bjornsson had missed out on last yearís title when one of his lifts in the Viking Press competition was disallowed. ìItís frustrating when something is taken that youíve worked hard for,î he said. But he had vowed to be back this year to finally claim the title. ìI could not stop, I would regret it forever,î he said. ìI am 28 years old today and am improving with each year.î"

My take on this question is simple, although I hope not simple-minded: Fake news is in large part a product of the enthusiasm ó not to say rage ó for transparency and absolutely free speech. I know that this is a counterintuitive proposition. I would like to begin my defense of it with an anecdote. In November 2016, Scott Titsworth, dean of the Scripps College of Communication at Ohio University, informed the university community of the first meeting of a presidential advisory group charged with recommending free speech policies for the campus. Titsworth reported that the groupís first action was to affirm transparency as one of its ìcore valuesî; the second action was to decide (unanimously) that its meetings would not be open to the public, but held in private. As you can imagine, it was easy to make fun of the obvious contradiction, but the contradiction is not so glaring once we understand that two notions of what ìfreeî means are in play here. The group wants (understandably) to be free of the pressures that would be felt if the proceedings were conducted under public scrutiny; at every moment members would be tempted to tailor what they said to the responses and criticisms of an imagined audience. In short, they would not be speaking freely but under a shadow if the meaning of ìfreelyî in force were ìentirely without filters, gatekeepers and boundaries.î That sense of ìfreelyî is championed by techno-utopians whose mantra is ìinformation wants to be freeî and who believe that the promised land predicted by the authors of every technological advance ó the printing press, newspapers, the telegraph, the railroad, radio, television, the digital computer, the internet ó is just around the corner. It is a land in which democracyís potential is finally realized in a communication community where all voices are recognized and none marginalized, with no one hoarding information or controlling access or deciding who speaks and who doesnít. What Titsworth and his fellow committee members see is that this more ambitious and abstract sense of ìfreelyî is antithetical to the successful completion of their task: Not speaking freely in front of everyone is a condition of speaking freely ó without anxiety and mental reservation ó on the way to exploring the complexities and difficulties of their charge. The moral (provisionally, and perhaps prematurely, drawn) is that transparency is not unambiguously a good thing. (I pass over for the moment the prior question of whether it is a possible thing.) And if that is right, then the proliferation of speech may not be a good thing either; silence and the withholding and sequestering of speech may be useful and even necessary in some contexts, like the preparing of a report or maintaining of a marriage. I say this aware that many free speech advocates believe that the more free speech there is the better the human condition will be, and who believe, too, that it is the business of our institutions, including our legislatures and courts, to increase the amount of speech available. At first glance the bias in favor of unlimited speech and information seems perfectly reasonable and even unassailable. What arguments could be brought against it? An answer to that question has been offered in recent years by a small, but growing, number of critics. In a 2009 essay in The New Republic titled ìAgainst Transparency,î the law professor Lawrence Lessig (known as an apostle of openness), asked, as I just have, ìHow could anyone be against transparency?î Lessig responds to his own question by quoting a trio of authors who in their book ìFull Disclosure: The Perils and Promise of Transparencyî observe that by itself information doesnít do anything; its effects depend on the motives of those who make use of it, and raw information (that is, data) cannot distinguish between benign and malign appropriations of itself. Misunderstanding and manipulation are always more than possible, and there is no way to assure that ìnew information is used to further public objectives.î Another way to put this is to say that information, data and the unbounded flow of more and more speech can be politicized ó it can, that is, be woven into a narrative that constricts rather than expands the area of free, rational choice. When that happens ó and it will happen often ó transparency and the unbounded flow of speech become instruments in the production of the very inequalities (economic, political, educational) that the gospel of openness promises to remove. And the more this gospel is preached and believed, the more that the answer to everything is assumed to be data uncorrupted by interests and motives, the easier it will be for interest and motives to operate under transparencyís cover. This is so because speech and data presented as if they were independent of any mechanism of selectivity will float free of the standards of judgment that are always the content of such mechanisms. Removing or denying the existence of gatekeeping procedures will result not in a fair and open field of transparency but in a field where manipulation and deception find no obstacles. Because it is an article of their faith that politics are bad and the unmediated encounter with data is good, internet prophets will fail to see the political implications of what they are trying to do, for in their eyes political implications are what they are doing away with. Indeed, their deepest claim ó so deep that they are largely unaware of it ó is that politics can be eliminated. They donít regard politics as an unavoidable feature of mortal life but as an unhappy consequence of the secular equivalent of the Tower of Babel: too many languages, too many points of view. Politics (faction and difference) will just wither away when the defect that generates it (distorted communication) has been eliminated by unmodified data circulated freely among free and equal consumers; everyone will be on the same page, reading from the same script and apprehending the same universal meanings. Back to Eden! This utopian fantasy rests on a positive, vaguely perfectionist view of human nature: Rather than being doomed by original sin to conflict, prejudice, hatred and an insatiable will to power, men and women are by nature communitarian, inclined to fellowship and the seeking of common ground. These good instincts, we are told, have been blocked by linguistic differences that can now be transcended by the digital revolution. A memorable Facebook news release written by Mark Zuckerberg a few years back, cited by Evgeny Morozov in his book ìTo Save Everything, Click Hereî tells the happy and optimistic story: ìBy enabling people from diverse backgrounds to easily connect and share their ideas, we can decrease world conflict in the short and long run.î The idea, Morozov explains, is that factions and conflict ìare simply the unfortunate result of an imperfect communication infrastructure.î If we perfect that infrastructure by devising a language of data algorithms and instantaneous electronic interaction that bypasses intervening and distorting institutions like the state, then communication would be perfect and undistorted, and society would be set on the right path without any further political efforts required. Talk about magical thinking! In the alternative and true story rehearsed by many, human difference is irreducible, and there is no ìneutral observation languageî (a term of the philosopher Thomas Kuhnís in his 1962 book ìThe Structure of Scientific Revolutionsî) that can bridge, soften, blur and even erase the differences. When people from opposing constituencies clash there is no common language to which they can refer their differences for mechanical resolution; there are only political negotiations that would involve not truth telling but propaganda, threats, insults, deceptions, exaggerations, insinuations, bluffs, posturings ó all the forms of verbal manipulation that will supposedly disappear in the internet nirvana. They wonít. Indeed, they will proliferate because the politically angled speech that is supposedly the source of our problems is in fact the only possible route to their (no doubt temporary) solution. Speech proceeding from a point of view can at least be recognized as such and then countered. You say, ìI know where those guys are coming from, and here are my reasons for believing that we should be coming from some place elseî ó and dialogue begins. It is dialogue inflected by interests and agendas, but dialogue still. But when speech (or information or data) is just sitting there inert, unattached to any perspective, when there are no guidelines, monitors, gatekeepers or filters, what you have are innumerable bits (like Lego) available for assimilation into any project a clever verbal engineer might imagine; and what you donít have is any mechanism that can stop or challenge the construction project or even assess it. What you have, in short, are the perfect conditions for the unchecked proliferation of what has come to be called ìfake news.î The rise of fake news has been attributed by some to the emergence of postmodern thought. Victor Davis Hanson, a scholar at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University wrote in 2017 that fake news can be ìtraced back to the campus,î specifically to ìacademic postmodernism,î which Hanson says, ìderides facts and absolutes, and insists that there are only narratives and interpretations.î Thatís not quite right. The insistence on the primacy of narratives and interpretations does not involve a deriding of facts but an alternative story of their emergence. Postmodernism sets itself against the notion of facts just lying there discrete and independent, and waiting to be described. Instead it argues that fact is the achievement of argument and debate, not a pre-existing entity by whose measure argument can be assessed. Arguments come first; when they are successful, facts follow ó at least for a while, until a new round of arguments replaces them with a new set of facts. This is far from the picture of Nietzschean nihilism that Hanson and others paint. Friction, not free invention, is the heart of the process: You commit yourself to the standards of evidence long in place in the conversation you enter, and then you maneuver as best you can within the guidelines of those standards. Thus, for example, a judge who issues a decision cannot simply decide which side he favors and then generate an opinion; he must first pass through and negotiate the authorized routes for getting there. Sometimes the effort at negotiation will fail and he will say that despite his interpretive desires, ìThis opinion just wonít write.î Any opinion will write if there are no routes to be negotiated or no standards to hew to, if nothing but your own interpretive desire prevents you from assembling or reassembling bits of unmoored data lying around in the world into a story that serves your purposes. It is not postmodernism that licenses this irresponsibility; it is the doctrine that freedom of information and transparency are all we need. Those who proclaim this theology can in good faith ignore or bypass all the usual routes of validation because their religion tells them that those routes are corrupt and that only the nonmethod of having no routes, no boundaries, no categories, no silos can bring us to the River Jordan and beyond. In many versions of Protestantism, parishioners are urged to reject merely human authority in any form and go directly to the pure word of God. For the technophiles the pure word of God is to be found in data. In fact, what is found in a landscape where data detached from any context abounds is the fracturing of the word into ever proliferating pieces of discourse, all existing side by side, indifferently approved, and without any way of distinguishing among them, of telling which of them are true or at least have a claim to be true and which are made up out of whole cloth. That is the world of fake news. It is created by the undermining of trust in the traditional vehicles of authority and legitimation ó major newspapers, professional associations, credentialed academics, standard encyclopedias, government bureaus, federal courts, prime-time nightly news anchors. When Walter Cronkite was the longtime anchor at CBS, he was known as the most trusted man in America; and when he signed off by saying, ìAnd thatís the way it is,î everyone believed him. In the brave new world of the internet, where authority is evenly distributed to everyone with a voice or a podcast, no one believes anybody, or (it is the same thing) everyone believes anybody. This wholesale distrust of authoritative mechanisms leads to the bizarre conclusion that an assertion of fact is more credible if it lacks an institutional source. In this way of thinking, a piece of news originating in a blog maintained by a teenager in a basement in Idaho would be more reliable than a piece of news announced by the anchor of a major network. And, again, what has brought us to this sorry pass is not the writings of Derrida or Foucault or any postmodern guru but the twin mantras of more free speech and absolute transparency."

Sanger,Politics,Domestic Politics,"US Politics, Donald Trump, Iran","WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> President Trump said on Monday that he was ready to announce whether he would pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, as European officials quietly indicated they had failed to convince the administration that dismantling the accord would be a huge diplomatic error. Diplomats who were familiar with the negotiations said Mr. Trump appeared inclined to scrap the deal and reimpose sanctions on Iran that were suspended in an accord reached in Vienna in July 2015. But it is unclear whether he would moderate that move, perhaps by allowing the European nations to move ahead with their economic relations with Tehran without being penalized by the United States. Mr. Trump issued two tweets about the coming decision. The first berated John Kerry, the former secretary of state, for his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran deal.‚<U+0080>ù It was an apparent reference to Mr. Kerry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s calls to leaders around the world looking for ways to save an accord that he dedicated much of his term during the Obama administration to negotiating. The United States does not need John Kerry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place! A few hours later, Mr. Trump, who has termed the accord a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>disaster‚<U+0080>ù and vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign to kill it, said that he would be announcing his decision at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the White House. I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm. Advertisement Withdrawing the United States from the deal will open the way for Tehran to resume making nuclear fuel. The agreement with world powers required Iran to ship about 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country, and to halt production of new fuel for 15 years. But Mr. Trump has argued that is not long enough, and that the accord failed to embrace Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s development of missiles and its support for terrorism around the Middle East. President Trump has called the Iran nuclear deal the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>worst deal ever.‚<U+0080>ù David E. Sanger, the national security correspondent for The Times, explains why the president is against the deal, and what that means for its future. In recent weeks, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany have visited Mr. Trump and urged him to keep the deal in place and negotiate new arrangements that would be built on top of the 2015 agreement.

They argued that if the United States withdraws, Iran could accurately claim that Washington was the first to violate the accord, and would be free, if it chose, to resume fuel production, according to diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My view ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know what your president will decide ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Macron told a group of reporters in Washington during his visit last month. Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, was in Washington on Monday to make the same case to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton. Both men had been vociferous opponents of the nuclear agreement in the past. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Now that these handcuffs are in place, I see no possible advantage in casting them aside, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Johnson wrote in The New York Times on Sunday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Only Iran would gain from abandoning the restrictions on its nuclear program.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Trump believes that once the current agreement is destroyed, Iran will come to the table to negotiate a new one. Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the initial accord with Mr. Kerry for more than two years, has said Tehran will not do that. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If America leaves the nuclear deal, this will entail historic regret for it, ‚<U+0080>ù President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said in a speech broadcast live on state television in recent days.

Warriors players and coaches, meanwhile, were almost universally unaware that the unit Kerr so often turns to when it comes to closing games had never actually started one together. But the Pelicans, after inflicting one rout upon the defending champions Friday night, had Golden State spooked. To counter New Orleans‚<U+0080><U+0099> fast pace and copious amounts of Davis, Kerr saw little alternative than to go smaller and start with his best lineup. Kerr has always preferred to save the group for crunchtime as opposed to first quarters ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even in the days when it was Harrison Barnes in Durant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s place. Concerns about the physical demands of playing so small ‚<U+0080><U+0094> both on Green as a 6-foot-7 center and on Iguodala at age 34 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have long been his primary worries. But Sunday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gambit came with the added risk that failure could have dented the Warriors‚<U+0080><U+0099> confidence in what has been a longstanding strategical cure-all. To Kerr‚<U+0080><U+0099>s relief, going away from the vast array of big men Golden State has stockpiled for this playoff run and starting Iguodala instead inspired a noticeable zip and sharpness at the start of the first and third quarters. Golden State zoomed to a 20-8 edge before Iguodala took his first rest. They hiked the lead to 18 points at the first-half peak and ultimately snuffed out the Pelicans‚<U+0080><U+0099> spirit with a dominant response after New Orleans had clawed to within 4 points shortly before intermission. Durant was the biggest beneficiary of the Warriors‚<U+0080><U+0099> increased focus and force, but Green (nine rebounds, nine assists and four steals) and Iguodala (29 turnover-free minutes and highly effective defense against the Pelicans‚<U+0080><U+0099> Nikola Mirotic) were huge difference-makers, too. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They do all the utility stuff, ‚<U+0080>ù Durant said. Speaking specifically about Iguodala and how much he keeps the Warriors organized ‚<U+0080><U+0094> at both ends ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Kerr resurrected his pet praise for the veteran swingman by saying: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He reminds me a lot of Scottie Pippen.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Ever the contrarian, Iguodala welcomed the lineup change and flattering comparison only to a degree. He was more interested in advancing the idea that the 19-point humbling that the Warriors endured in Game 3 actually might have benefited them, with Curry still working his way back from the knee sprain that sidelined him from March 24 until Game 2 of this series. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been doing this for a long time and people can say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>How do you get bored of winning?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Iguodala said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But with everything that comes with it, it can be a mental drain. So sometimes it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s good for us to lose. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was good for us to kind of get punched in the mouth and see how we responded.‚<U+0080>ù The numerical response: Kerr kept his Game 4 starters on the floor for 18 minutes, during which the group posted a cumulative plus/minus of +26. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any time we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been in danger over the years, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve gone to this group, ‚<U+0080>ù Kerr said at the postgame podium. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re on the road, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re threatened, you put your five best players out there.‚<U+0080>ù Yet Kerr insisted after his victorious news conference, in a hallway outside the visitors‚<U+0080><U+0099> locker room, that he would continue to be judicious with how much he leans on his most feared five-man combination ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for its own good. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t play that way the whole season, ‚<U+0080>ù Kerr said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll blow those guys out ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and I mean blow them out physically.‚<U+0080>ù For long stretches of the season, of course, injuries (especially Curry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s) didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even make it an option to trot out Curry/Thompson/Iguodala/Durant/Green as much as the Warriors would have liked. Expect to see more and more of that alignment as the prospect of a third championship in four seasons dribbles closer into view for Golden State. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re always going to get to that lineup eventually, ‚<U+0080>ù Kerr said as he headed for the team bus. Some of the principles even embrace the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hamptons Five‚<U+0080>ù concept coined by the longtime Bay Area columnist Tim Kawakami.

That is no surprise. But the most encouraging part of their best start in 15 years ó 24 wins, 10 losses ó is the killer instinct that shows up repeatedly, even after they have proven the point. The best teams are the greediest. They enjoy the meal, but wonít savor it until they grab the last slice of cake off your plate. As the Boston Red Sox arrive for a three-game clash starting Tuesday, the Yankees have been on a merciless tear. They played 18 games in 18 days, in three time zones, and won all five series. They staged ninth-inning comebacks to finish three of them, all against playoff teams from last season. Gleyber Torres joined the party in progress, on April 22, and the Yankees have lost only once since he arrived. No everyday player since 1900 had ever started and won 14 of his first 15 games before Torres, a 21-year-old shortstop who is shining at second base. He is not surprised. ìNot really,î Torres said on Sunday. ìI mean, that team is super awesome. The bullpen, the starting pitchers, everybody is super good. Any opportunity we have, everybody helps do the job.î It was Torresís turn on Sunday, and he ushered out the Cleveland Indians with a three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning. It was the second home series in a row to end with a three-run blast by a young Yankee cornerstone that sealed a series sweep. Gary Sanchez did it to the Minnesota Twins on April 26. In between ó with no travel days ó the Yankees swept the Angels in Anaheim, Calif., and took three of four in Houston from the World Series champion Astros. ìWhen we started on this, I looked at it as this 18-game snapshot, because we knew we didnít have an off-day so we knew it was going to be a grind against a lot of great teams,î Manager Aaron Boone said. ìWhatís been cool about it is weíve shown we can win in a lot of different ways. Weíve won pitchersí duels. Weíve won when weíve had to scratch against the other teamís closer. Weíve won when weíve really swung the bats in a massive way and run away with something. The starting pitchers have been incredibly consistent, the bullpenís been strong, and I feel like our defense has continued to get better.î That about covers it: close games and blowouts, hitting and pitching and defense. The only cause for concern is that, while the Yankees have a better record than 28 teams, they trail the Red Sox. The Yankees are 18-3 since the teams last tangled at Fenway Park, but still looking up in the standings. The Red Sox are 25-9, and they seem like themselves again. Remember last season, when they won the American League East but finished last in the league in home runs? Now they lead the majors in slugging percentage. Mookie Betts bruised his right shoulder on Sunday, but that should not slow his Willie Mays impersonation: a .355 average with 13 homers. Bostonís five-year, $110 million investment in J.D. Martinez (.349, 8 homers) looks like a steal. The ace Chris Sale, who pitched on Sunday, will miss this series. The left-hander Drew Pomeranz faces the Yankeesí Luis Severino on Tuesday, with David Price against Masahiro Tanaka on Wednesday and Rick Porcello versus C.C. Sabathia on Thursday. The more anticipated matchup, if it happens, is Joe Kelly against the Yankeesí Tyler Austin. Kelly, the hard-throwing Red Sox reliever, plunked Austin at Fenway on April 11, payback for Austinís spiking Brock Holt with a slide at second base. The brawl that followed has made Kelly a hero in Boston ó he got a standing ovation at a Bruins game a few days later ó and inspired a promotion at the Class AAA Pawtucket Red Sox series with the Yankeesí affiliate over the weekend. Fans named Joe or Kelly got in free, and the team auctioned an autographed Joe Kelly boxing glove, among other items, for his charity. Austin, for his part, had little to say on Sunday about the rematch. ìI donít want to get into all that right now,î he said. ìI just want to enjoy this day off. But I think weíre all excited to play Boston. I feel like weíre taking every day like that: weíre coming out to compete and win ballgames, whether itís Boston or whoever it is.î On Sunday it was Cleveland, and a top closer, Cody Allen, who could not protect a four-run lead. Mike Clevinger had one-hit the Yankees through seven shutout innings, but he walked Neil Walker to start the eighth. With one out, he walked Austin and left the game. Walker, a 10-year veteran, is new to the team, a mid-March signing whose price dropped so steeply on the open market (one year, $4 million) that the Yankees could not resist. They were already covered in professional hitters and versatile infielders, but they got greedy. They got better. Walkerís double tied the score in the ninth, and he scored when Torresís homer won it. Walker loved how Torres did it: falling behind in the count, taking three balls, running a full count and then hammering the sixth pitch of his at-bat over the center-field fence. It is the same approach Walker sees in Miguel Andujar, the rookie third baseman who singled to end Fridayís win. ìGuys are in there trying to do something to keep the ball rolling, not just hoping to get a hit but taking whatís coming,î Walker said. ìThatís a hard lesson to learn as a player, so itís really interesting to see guys like Gleyber and Miguel putting together really good at-bats ó not just in the first inning and middle innings, but in the late innings. Itís easy to get caught up in the moment, and youíre not seeing guys do that.î They are not getting caught up in the moment. They are making the moment theirs. Now the Yankees face the only team that has done it better this season, the one rival who always matters most."

Finds","The attack on a religious gathering in Kunduz killed at least 36 people, a United Nations report said, of whom at least 30 were boys.","Fahim Abed, Rod Nordland",World,International,"Civilian casualties, Afghanistan War, UN, Taliban, Dasht-e-Archi, Kunduz","KABUL, Afghanistan ó Of more than 100 people killed or wounded in an Afghan government airstrike last month, most were children at a religious gathering, United Nations officials have concluded, contradicting Afghan officials who have claimed that the target was a Taliban planning session. In a damning report issued on Monday, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Unama, stopped short of calling the April 2 airstrike a war crime, but said it raised ìquestions as to the governmentís respect of the rules of precaution and proportionality under international humanitarian law.î At least 36 people were killed and 71 wounded, of whom 30 of the dead and 51 of the wounded were children, Unama found, but the toll may have been much higher. It counted only those casualties that could be confirmed by three independent sources, and said that many other people were reported killed or injured by one or two sources; some local officials put the death toll as high as 70. Rights workers described a disturbing pattern of behavior by a government that no longer complains about civilian casualties from airstrikes, now that its own forces are carrying out most of those attacks. American airstrikes, especially in the Kunduz area, once aroused a great deal of government criticism, and the United States has at times apologized. ìThe rise in civilian casualties from Afghan government air operations is deeply troubling,î said Patricia Gossman of Human Rights Watch. ìThere is little capacity or commitment to carry out robust investigations; those that are done are ad hoc and ó as in this case ó never made public.î A member of the Afghan presidentís fact-finding commission, Sangin Tawakalzai, said as recently as Monday that Kunduz officials had claimed only nine had been killed. The United Nations report said that the airstrike had hit a well-publicized outdoor religious gathering in the Dasht-e-Archi district of Kunduz Province, a district that has long been dominated by the Taliban, and has seen heavy fighting with government forces. Over 400 posters had been distributed in the area in advance, announcing what was said to be a graduation program at a madrasa, or religious school. While many local officials said that Taliban officials attended in large numbers, Unama said it could not confirm how many of the dead were Taliban. The report said that the 36 confirmed dead were all male, but only six of them were adults, and the others were apparently boys from a nearby religious school. Government MD-530 helicopter gunships attacked the crowd, firing into a section full of children first, with rockets and .50 caliber heavy machine guns, the report said, describing the arms used as ìimprecise weapons.î The children were struck first because they were in the rear of the crowd, and most accessible from overhead. Afghan officials from the Ministry of Defense and the presidency repeatedly either declined to comment on Unamaís findings, or did not respond to inquiries. They have claimed the airstrike was on a Taliban planning session that included several high-ranking Taliban officials. ìI donít want to comment on figures of civilian casualties provided by Unama,î said Shah Hussain Murtazawi, President Ashraf Ghaniís deputy spokesman. ìOur investigation also shows that there were some civilian casualties, but the main target was the Taliban gathering.î Mr. Murtazawi said he could not provide further detail, however, because the governmentís own report had yet to be formally presented to the presidentís National Security Council. He said that the Kunduz attack had prompted the government ìto take more measures to prevent civilian casualties in airstrikes,î but he did not specify what those measures were. Ms. Gossman, of Human Rights Watch, said, ìThe government seems wary of releasing information about large numbers of civilian casualties, since to do so means confronting those in the security forces responsible.î The United Nations in Afghanistan has also criticized the insurgents, blaming them for the majority of civilian casualties in the war, particularly from suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices that often deliberately target civilians. The latest United Nations report said 67 percent of civilian casualties could be attributed to the insurgents. Until recent months, most aerial attacks in Afghanistan were carried out by American-led coalition forces, and many still are, though with increased standards of caution to avoid civilian casualties, according to American officials. At least four American airstrikes in Kunduz in recent years resulted in claims of civilian casualties. In one hotly disputed attack just outside Kunduz city last November, the American military launched airstrikes after two of its soldiers had been killed, apparently killing civilians who had been ordered by the Taliban to recover the dead and wounded. The United States at first denied killing any civilians, but reversed its position after an investigation and said 33 civilians had died in the incident. The American commander, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., apologized for the loss of life."

Ovechkin has been in the N.H.L. for 13 years, but until Monday night he had never made it past the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. That long dry spell finally ended after the Capitals beat Pittsburgh in overtime, 2-1, to oust the Penguins in six games. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s awesome. It feels great. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve never been in this position before, ‚<U+0080>ù Ovechkin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m looking forward to it.‚<U+0080>ù The Capitals will face the Tampa Bay Lightning in what will be Ovechkin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first Eastern Conference final. The Lightning, who finished with the best record in the East, are in the conference finals for the third time in the past four years and loaded up at the trade deadline for a Stanley Cup run. Advertisement The Capitals finally made it into new territory after a decade of coming painfully close. Washington was eliminated by Pittsburgh in the seventh game of the conference semifinals last year. The Caps were eliminated in the same round by the Rangers in 2015 after taking a 3-1 series lead. They lost Game 7s to the Rangers in 2012 and in 2013. With 607 goals in 1,003 regular-season N.H.L. games and another 54 goals in 109 playoff games, Ovechkin, 32, has been prolific, but his accomplishments have been tempered by his team‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lackluster postseason performances. Besides the Capitals moving past the second round for the first time since 1998, this is the first time that Washington Coach Barry Trotz, an N.H.L. coach for 19 seasons, has taken one of his teams beyond the conference semifinals. Trotz knew exactly what Ovechkin was enduring. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s thrown in Ovi‚<U+0080><U+0099>s face everywhere he turns, ‚<U+0080>ù Trotz said. He pointed out that the Capitals are merely halfway to their first Stanley Cup, but they do not have to talk about the dismal past anymore. They beat Pittsburgh, the two-time defending champion, by showing resilience. Trotz said he handed Ovechkin a different sort of challenge Monday morning before Game 6: He told Ovechkin, who scored 49 goals in the regular season and eight in the playoffs, that it would be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>more important to check correctly.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I talked to him about leading the charge there, ‚<U+0080>ù Trotz said. Ovechkin had five shots on goal, with five more attempts blocked and another that missed the goal, but he was also credited with a game-high seven hits. He also shook off an injury to his right hand after he was slashed in the second period by Pittsburgh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Kris Letang. And Ovechkin did assist on the winning goal, shoveling a pass to center Evgeny Kuznetsov that he turned into a breakaway. Less than three minutes after Pittsburgh forward Tom Kuhnhackl hit the goal-post with a shot, Kuznetsov ended the game 5 minutes 27 seconds into overtime. But the Capitals also got a second-period goal from the fourth-line winger Alex Chiasson, who took a pass from Nathan Walker ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an Australian native in his first playoff game ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and slammed his first playoff goal between the legs of Pittsburgh goaltender Matt Murray. Advertisement The Capitals, who were without the injured center Nicklas Backstrom and forward Andre Burakovsky and the suspended forward Tom Wilson, dressed five rookies on Monday. Trotz still thought the Capitals would win ‚<U+0080><U+0094> especially after Kuhnhackl hit the goal-post. When Washington goaltender Braden Holtby was asked about how the Caps might have motivated themselves by overcoming their past, he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think we have time to focus on that.‚<U+0080>ù Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Holtby was strong again Monday, allowing only a second-period goal by Letang that deflected off the stick of Washington forward Chandler Stephenson before it skipped past him. Holtby gave up 13 goals on 164 shots in the series to the potent Penguins. But Ovechkin has been the Capitals‚<U+0080><U+0099> focal point since he joined the team, and the television cameras pulled in tight when the traditional post-series handshake line formed after the game. Crosby, first in line, shook Ovechkin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hand, patted him and wished him well. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been in that position lots of times, ‚<U+0080>ù Ovechkin said. The Penguins had eliminated the Capitals from the 2016 and 2017 playoffs before winning back-to-back Stanley Cups. Their quest for a three-peat ended Monday, and the Penguins were warmly applauded by their fans when they left the ice after the game. A half-hour later, Trotz sat at a postgame news conference and said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s good getting past the Penguins. It was a skeleton in the closet.‚<U+0080>ù The Caps would have had one more chance to win the series, but they are 3-7 in Game 7s in the Ovechkin Era.

On Tuesday, Mr. Pashinyan became Armeniaís interim prime minister, when a Parliament dominated by his political foes elected him by a 59-to-42 vote. After vowing to remake the countryís political and economic systems, Mr. Pashinyan told a cheering throng in the central Republic Square in Yerevan, the capital, that, ìYour victory is not that I was elected as prime minister of Armenia; your victory is that you decided who should be prime minister of Armenia.î Tens of thousands had gathered in the square, cheering wildly and waving the countryís red, blue and orange flag as the vote was broadcast live on giant monitors. On March 31, Mr. Pashinyan, 42, a balding man with a salt-and-pepper beard and slight paunch, began a quixotic walk across central Armenia to protest an effort by the president to skirt term limits. Few paid much attention at first. Yet within three weeks, Mr. Pashinyan, a former newspaper editor and political prisoner, had galvanized a civil disobedience movement that transformed the countryís political landscape. It forced the retirement of Serzh Sargsyan, the president for the past decade, and shoved aside the long-dominant Republican Party. It was the most sweeping change in this small, landlocked country of about 2.8 million people in the southern Caucasus since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Mr. Pashinyanís election on Tuesday was all the more remarkable because it happened in the backyard of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who sent his congratulations. Popular protests tend to alarm Mr. Putin, and he has invaded other former Soviet states, Georgia and Ukraine, where he saw Russian interests and influence being threatened. Russia considers Armenia of such strategic importance that it maintains a military base in the country, and helps guard Armeniaís borders with Turkey and Iran. But by focusing on strictly domestic problems while pledging eternal brotherhood with Moscow, Mr. Pashinyan deftly avoided a military intervention by the Kremlin. ìThere are no foreign forces involved in this process,î Mr. Pashinyan said over lunch. ìI have insisted many times that there is no geopolitical context to our movement, our velvet revolution.î If many Armenians find it nothing short of miraculous that their country seems transformed overnight, Mr. Pashinyan described it as the culmination of a journey that began some 20 years ago. As a journalism student at Yerevan State University, he wrote screeds against corruption, and was expelled in 1995 before he could graduate. He later become the editor in chief of the newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak, where he continued polemical attacks against politicians and rich businessman. His car, a Lada Niva, was set on fire outside the newspaperís offices in 2004. In 2008, he helped organize street protests against what many considered a tainted presidential election. Some still blame him for bloody clashes that resulted in the deaths of 10 people, although he denies provoking the violence. ìI didnít trust him,î said Anahit Sahakyan, 42, the owner of the bohemian Ilik cafe in central Yerevan. ìHe would shout, ëThey treat you like slaves! They treat you like dogs!í He was trying to arouse the animal instincts in people. I didnít like it.î Wanted by the government, Mr. Pashinyan went on the lam for 16 months. ìThat was the hardest time we experienced,î said his wife, Anna Hakobyan, 40, who met him in journalism school. A security services officer moved into their apartment, in case he showed up. With Mr. Pashinyan in hiding, Ms. Hakobyan took over the newspaper, while also caring for their three children; they now have four. She did not see him for six months, but she heard from him ó he sent notes accusing her of destroying the paper, along with occasional praise. ìThat was stressful,î she said, laughing. Eventually, she would visit him for a few days, changing cars as she moved across Yerevan to lose the officers tailing her. ìJust like the movies,î she said. In 2009, Mr. Pashinyan turned himself in, and was sentenced to seven years in prison, thrown in with violent criminals. One night, two masked men entered his cell and kicked him to the ground. ìI am proud that I experienced it and was able to stay true to myself in that strange environment under all different kinds of pressure,î he said. He learned English and read a lot. When he returned to their modest, two-bedroom, fourth-floor walk-up after a 2011 amnesty, he was a stranger to their daughter, Shushan, who had been an infant when he was locked up. ìWhat is Daddy for?î she asked, puzzled. Elected to Parliament in 2012, he joined a weak alliance of nine opposition members. He infuriated many opposition activists in 2015 by not opposing the governing partyís move to alter the Constitution, shifting most presidential powers to the prime minister. Last month, term limits forced Mr. Sargsyan to step down as president, but he held onto power by having Parliament elect him prime minister, despite his pledge not to seek that office. When his plan became clear, Mr. Pashinyan began preparing his protest. ìI understood that the best way to prevent violence is to be nonviolent,î he said. Drawing inspiration from Nelson Mandela and from Gandhiís famous 1930 walk across India to protest British taxation, Mr. Pashinyan decided to walk around 120 miles across Armenia from Gyumri, the second-largest city, to Yerevan. Opponents mocked him for wearing a camouflage-pattern T-shirt, accusing him of trying to disguise his lack of military service. He laughed off the criticism, and the shirt became a signature. His beard and clothes set him apart from the slick haircuts and suits favored by the governing party. His supporters saw his look as fitting for a man they described as down-to-earth, smart, spontaneous and far less volatile then he had been in his youth. Students were already protesting by the time he reached Yerevan on April 13, and the crowds grew with each step the government took. On April 17, Mr. Sargsyan become prime minister, and on April 22 he tried to decapitate the protest movement by having Mr. Pashinyan detained. Instead, hundreds of thousands of Armenians took to the streets, shouting ìNikol! Nikol!î Bowing to pressure, Mr. Sargsyan stepped down. The demonstrations swelled, with Mr. Pashinyan, again free, stressing that if the police used force, protesters should just raise their hands and surrender. He told the police repeatedly that they were friends and fellow Armenians. Many of those who had been skeptical became supporters. ìHe is one of the few political guys in Armenia who really changed,î said Samvel Martirosyan, a specialist in internet security and a veteran political observer. ìHe became smarter, calmer, he speaks really well.î On May 1, the governing party, which holds 58 out of 105 seats in Parliament, voted down his bid to become interim prime minister. So Mr. Pashinyan went to Yerevanís central Republic Square, the throbbing heart of the protests, where an estimated 250,000 people had gathered, and called for a nationwide strike at 8:15 the next morning. Supporters brought the country to a halt, joking that it was a measure of Mr. Pashinyanís influence that he could make Armenians do things on time. Parliament met again on Tuesday to choose a leader, and this time Mr. Pashinyan prevailed. He said his first priority was to organize the first fair parliamentary elections in many years. Mr. Pashinyan has vowed to break up the cozy system of oligarchic monopolies and invigorate an economy that has left a third of the country in poverty. After 30 years of fighting with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region both countries claim, he has said he will make the enclave part of Armenia. He brushes aside fears that he has set expectations so high that he is bound to disappoint. ìI am in a working mood, there is no sense of euphoria, just work to do,î Mr. Pashinyan said. ìIf we were able to do the impossible, that means we will be able to do the difficult.î"

Benjamin Netanyahu is now close to becoming Israelís longest-serving prime minister. Haunted by scandal, the Likud leader is a controversial figure at home and abroad. He makes headlines and arouses strong feelings because he deals with big and enormously divisive issues ó war and peace in the Middle East, the nuclear ambitions of Iran, the future of the Palestinians and the fate of the Jewish people, not necessarily in that order. He has a strong sense of history and especially of his own indispensable role in making it.` Anshel Pfefferís biography is superbly timed ó appearing as Israeli justice closes in on a man who has been in power for nearly a decade and is a major player in what he famously calls a ìtough neighborhoodî for far longer. Bibi, as he is known at home (though the use of his childhood nickname does not automatically imply affection), comes across as a more complex figure than his legendary mastery of the sound bite suggests. Family background and tribal politics are two of the main strands of his story. America, where he spent much of his early life and formative stages of his career, is another significant one. If there is a master key to cracking the Bibi code, this insightful and readable book argues, it is his identity as someone who has always stood outside the mainstream. This distance is something of a family inheritance. Netanyahuís grandfather and father were members of the right-wing ìRevisionistî movement at a time when Zionism was dominated by the left in Eastern Europe, America and Palestine. There is a familiar theme in Israelís history ó most eloquently evoked by the late Israeli writer Amos Elon ó that the stateís founding fathers and their sons behaved very differently. In the case of the Netanyahus, the ìinability to become part of the establishment,î as Pfeffer puts it, made for unusual continuity between the generations. Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv in 1949, a year after Israelís independence and what Palestinians call the Nakba (ìcatastropheî) forged one of the worldís most intractable conflicts. His experience attending high school in Philadelphia, where his father had taken an academic job, instilled in him views that were out of sync with then ìlittleî Israelís collectivist ethos. He has often been accused by his critics over the years of being more American than Israeli. His elder brother Yoni, an officer in the Israeli Armyís elite Sayeret Matkal unit, was a powerful influence, one magnified by grief when Yoni was killed in the Entebbe hostage rescue mission in 1976. Bibi served in the same unit. His role commemorating the fallen hero provided his first intense exposure to public life. By the early 1980s, after studying at M.I.T. and working as a management consultant, Netanyahu was a rising star at Israelís Washington embassy. It was there, and later as ambassador to the United Nations, that he honed his formidable public relations skills (known as ìhasbaraî in Hebrew), befriending columnists, talk-show hosts and influential and wealthy Jewish and other Americans, including the real-estate entrepreneur Donald Trump. In 1988, as the first Palestinian intifada was challenging the status quo of the post-1967 occupation, he went home to join the Likud Party. The world beyond the Beltway first noticed him on CNN, donning a gas mask on air during the 1991 gulf war. Pfeffer is one of the smartest and most prolific of Israelís younger generation of journalists. His work for Haaretz reflects that paperís liberal bent, instinctively opposed to Netanyahu and much of what he represents. It is hard to imagine that this author ever voted for his subject. Bibi, obsessed by hostile ìleft-wingî media, complained pre-emptively that this biography would be a ìcartoon.î It is not: It fleshes out a superficially familiar and invariably quotable figure with a wealth of background information and analysis that provide necessary and, of course, often highly critical context. Yet it is also fair. In 1995, before the trauma of Yitzhak Rabinís assassination by a Jewish extremist, Netanyahu was widely accused of ìincitement.î Not fair, Pfeffer concludes, explaining that Netanyahu nevertheless chose to ride the ìfar-right tiger.î Yasir Arafat paid Rabinís widow a condolence call; Bibi was not welcome but he still won an election, albeit by a tiny margin, soon afterward. Another interesting observation on Pfefferís part is that Netanyahu is no fan of military action, tending to caution and even indecision, rejecting, for example, a ground offensive after the Israeli air campaign in the Gaza war of 2014. Pfeffer rightly focuses on Bibiís attitude toward the Palestinians. In his first term of office in 1996, he inherited Rabinís landmark Oslo agreement with the P.L.O., which the Likud opposed, but still grudgingly complied with it. Back in power in 2009 after a period that encompassed the second intifada, Arafatís death and Ariel Sharonís unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, he came to appreciate how Oslo maintained Israelís security while allowing settlements to expand as the American-led ìpeace processî went nowhere slowly. Netanyahu was initially seen as committed to a two-state solution while simultaneously demanding that Palestinians recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. But a few years later the most he was prepared to contemplate was a ìstate-minus.î Rivals further to the right do not even go that far. ìThe only peace he has been willing to consider,î Pfeffer concludes, ìis one where Israel bullies the Palestinians into submission. Until that happens, he will continue building walls.î Netanyahu, in this view, has always seen the Palestinian issue as a diversion ó a ìrabbit holeî that misinformed Westerners insist on going down. Terrorism and unchanging Arab and Muslim hostility were and remain his preferred emphases. In recent years his ìprimary obsessionî has been the danger from Iran, whose plans to acquire nuclear weapons (and break Israelís regional monopoly on them) he says threaten a new Holocaust. Barack Obamaís support for the 2015 Iranian nuclear agreement and his efforts to curb Israeli settlements meant that mutual loathing between president and prime minister was inevitable. Trump is a different and of course unfinished story. (Bibiís aides, perhaps unsurprisingly, have begun branding unfavorable media reports as ìfake news.î) Bibiís standing has been tarnished by investigations into bribery and corruption ó accused of accepting gifts of cash, champagne and cigars ó and by the antics of his wife, Sara, whose tantrums and lavish sense of entitlement at public expense made for damaging leaks. Acquiring the loyalty of his own uncritical right-wing media outlet was one response. Sowing fear and promoting division were others: For his fourth election victory in 2015 the Bibi campaign bombarded disenchanted Likud supporters with messages about the dangers of a Palestinian state and racist warnings about Arab citizens voting ìin droves.î The result is an erosion of Israelís democracy. Still, Netanyahu wins standing ovations from supporters, in particular in the United States. For better or worse he embodies Israel as a modern, ìhybrid society of ancient phobias and high-tech hope, a combination of tribalism and globalism.î Netanyahu sees himself, Pfeffer points out, not just as Israelís premier but as the leader of the Jewish people and he seems little concerned with the problem that bedevils Zionism 70 years after the birth of the Jewish state: what to do about the other people who inhabit that bitterly contested land. In fact, the greatest achievement of Bibiís career can be seen as a negative one, as Pfeffer describes it, ìtrying to ensure that Israel did not have clearly defined or internationally recognized borders.î This book is a necessary contribution to understanding a high-profile and internationally contentious figure and the fractured country he has led for so long. It is, inevitably, already out of date. But Bibiís turbulent times are not over yet. Updated editions look certain."

The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential. The news of the virtual exchange, which has not been reported before, came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a Bitcoin trading unit ó most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank. The moves by Goldman and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, mark a dramatic shift toward the mainstream for a digital token that has been known primarily for its underworld associations and status as a high-risk, speculative investment. The new interest among Wall Street power brokers also represents a surprising new chapter in the renegade history of Bitcoin. The virtual currency was created after the 2008 global financial crisis by a still-anonymous programmer who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldnít be controlled by a handful of powerful organizations. But instead of being replaced, the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency, sometimes called cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions ó without any financial institutions getting involved ó it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver. Details of the platform that Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart, given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies. A spokesman said that the company had no comment. Many corporations and governments have expressed interest in the technology that Bitcoin introduced, particularly a form of database known as the blockchain. Some large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customerís account at the end of the trade. ICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day ó with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project. The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws ó something todayís Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do. The chief executive of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman, recently said her company could also create a virtual-currency exchange if regulatory issues are ironed out. While several hedge funds have been buying and selling Bitcoin, most large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, have avoided it largely as a result of similar regulatory concerns. Bitcoin still faces plenty of skepticism in the mainstream financial world. Over the weekend, Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who has long been critical of virtual currencies, said Bitcoin was ìprobably rat poison squaredî in an interview with CNBC. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates added his own skepticism, saying heíd ìshortî Bitcoin if he could. And the new efforts to trade Bitcoin donít help answer basic questions about what makes the virtual currency useful in the real world. Most attempts to use Bitcoin for everyday commerce havenít gained traction, and investors have treated it as a speculative commodity like gold or silver. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts have said that its increasing integration into the existing financial system has pulled it away from its founding ideals. Paul Chou, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who set up LedgerX, a regulated Bitcoin exchange that would compete with Intercontinental Exchange, said his company has made a point of focusing on large Bitcoin holders, rather than financial institutions. ìThe reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank, but to replace them,î Mr. Chou said, using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies. ìWe deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of Bitcoinís strengths, while avoiding brokers, banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transaction.î Goldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to Bitcoinís price. But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual Bitcoins. Intercontinental Exchangeís effort, if it pans out, could make Bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base, including other financial firms. Several big corporate names, including the giant technology investor SoftBank, which has stakes in Sprint and Uber, have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way, the people familiar with the project said. But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involved. LedgerX, the exchange founded by Mr. Chou, is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed. LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months, but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institutions is already hooked into it. The interest in Bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has, after a rocky start, improved. Regulators are currently looking at whether many virtual currencies, including the second most widely used digital token, Ether, have been issued and traded in violation of securities regulations. Institutional investors believe that because of the way Bitcoin was created and structured ó without any one company or organization behind it ó it would be on safer ground with regulators. ICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether, but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty, the people briefed on the effort said. Mr. Chou, at LedgerX, said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to Ether. With Bitcoin, on the other hand, Mr. Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involved. ìThe industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoinís history,î he said. ìIíve been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. Itís a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions ó I think weíre finally there.î"
61,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:07,20:22:39,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/opinion/black-cube-ben-rhodes-colin-kahl.html,Why Did a Creepy Israeli Intel Firm Spy on Obama Alums?,We need a congressional investigation into the Black Cube scandal.,Michelle Goldberg,Opinion,Domestic Politics,"US Politics, Private investigator, Iran, Israel, Barack Obama, Benjamin J Rhodes, Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, Black Cube","On Saturday, the British newspaper The Observer published an article that, if true, should rocket into the top tier of Donald Trump scandals. Aides to the president, it said, ìhired an Israeli private intelligence agency to orchestrate a ëdirty opsí campaign against key individuals from the Obama administration who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal.î The Israeli agents, said The Observer, specifically targeted Ben Rhodes, who had been one of Barack Obamaís national security advisers, and Colin Kahl, a deputy assistant to Obama and national security adviser to Joe Biden. The idea, apparently, was to smear them as corrupt in order to discredit the Iran deal as a whole. The Observer did not identify the Israeli intelligence firm. But on Twitter, Kahl described a strange overture made to his wife last year, when she was serving on the fund-raising committee for their daughterís elementary school. A woman claiming to represent a British private equity firm interested in donating to the school emailed his wife and insisted that they meet. (Kahl and his wife were suspicious, and the meeting never happened.) As Laura Rozen, a foreign policy journalist, reported, the woman who emailed Kahlís wife claimed to work for Reuben Capital Partners. Thatís the same fake firm that a female operative for the Israeli intelligence firm Black Cube used as a cover when she spied on the actress Rose McGowan for Harvey Weinstein. Sure enough, on Sunday, The New Yorkerís Ronan Farrow confirmed that it was Black Cube that targeted Kahl and Rhodes. (The company had also tried to get to Rhodes through his wife.) Additionally, wrote Farrow, Black Cube ìcompiled a list of more than 30 reporters who it believed were in touch with Obama administration officials, annotated with instructions about how to seek negative information.î In a remotely normal America, Congress would immediately plan hearings into Black Cube. Of course, thatís not the America we live in. ìWeíre in an era right now in which thereís so many scandals that itís impossible to appropriately react to all of them because we would just be completely emotionally drained,î said Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council and author of ìLosing an Enemy: Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy.î During the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations, Parsi, who was an informal adviser to Obama during negotiations with Iran, said that an American intelligence source warned him, through a third party, that Trump would try to discredit him and other supporters of the Iran deal. Parsi recently discovered, thanks to a reporter covering the Black Cube story, that he had been interviewed last year by a Black Cube operative posing as a journalist. Speaking of the warning and the Black Cube encounter, he told me, ìI have little reason to believe that theyíre not linked.î There are still a great many unknowns in this story, which, like so much of this administration, has a wild, dystopian implausibility. Contrary to the Observerís reporting, a source told Farrow that Black Cube was working on behalf of a private-sector client, not the Trump administration. Black Cube itself denied working for Trump or anyone close to him. A report in the Israeli media said the operation was related to a dispute between shipping companies. But at a minimum, itís outrageous that Black Cube, a company of former Israeli intelligence agents, appears to have spied on Americans to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement, which Trump seems poised to pull out of on Tuesday. Itís grotesque that Black Cube did so by targeting the spouses of former Obama administration officials. And if Trumpís team had any role at all in using foreign spies against American citizens, it should end his presidency, even if it probably wonít. When I spoke to Kahl on Monday, he described the shipping company explanation as ìlaughably implausible.î Kahl emphasized that he has no idea who was behind the approach to his wife. But he points out that Trump officials were obsessed with him and Rhodes; on Fox News, the former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka spoke darkly about the ìBen Rhodes-Colin Kahl nexus.î ìIn the spring of last year, there was a group of senior aides at the White House who, maybe because of Ben and my social media presence on Twitter, were convinced that somehow we were the puppet-masters that were pulling all the strings of the deep state,î he said. ìI know that sounds crazy. It is crazy.î But to Kahl, itís hard to imagine why someone who wasnít caught up in conspiracy theories about him and Rhodes would single out the two of them for surveillance. ìI have zero ó zero ó evidence that Trump aides did this,î Kahl told me. ìNone. But it needs to be explained, this weird coincidence of this strange fixation on Ben and me by a handful of White House aides at the exact same moment in time that this Israeli firm gets hired to dig into us and our families.î Parsi believes it will be. ìI think this is just the beginning,î he said. ìI think weíre going to find out more about what this firm has done, and what this administration has done.î If so, it will be up to the rest of us to make sure that it matters."

It was a copy of a copy of a Latin Mass by the 18th-century composer Domenico Zipoli that had crossed the Atlantic and most of South America, only to be stuffed into a box for three centuries in a derelict jungle church where humidity had taken its toll. And then there were the termites. The insects had eaten large tracts of the Mass, including the 22nd and 23rd measures. But while much of the work of Zipoli has vanished in his native Europe, it has managed to survive in eastern Bolivia ‚<U+0080><U+0094> along with his vast Baroque musical tradition, which hums through the tropical lowlands. Here near the borders of Brazil and Paraguay, harpsichords and lutes can be found in the smallest villages. Luthiers have carved violins from local cedar for centuries. Advertisement And troves of ancient manuscripts, more recently rediscovered in church archives, have once again revived Zipoli and other composers of the period, whose music is played in elementary schools and on the radio. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Baroque is our tradition here, ‚<U+0080>ù said Juan Vaca, an archivist in Concepci√≥n, leafing through the crumbling pages of the Zipoli Mass with a pair of gloves and a small rod. The score is a legacy of Jesuit missionaries who left a musical time capsule in Bolivia. By the 1700s, parts of what is now Paraguay, eastern Bolivia and southern Brazil were vast forests of seminomadic native peoples and the slave traders who hunted them. Surrounding the jungles were the Spanish and Portuguese Empires. The Jesuits descended into the jungles with the twin goals of converting indigenous tribes and sheltering them from enslavement. In the process, they formed a state-within-a-state ruled by priests and local chieftains. This obscure corner of Latin American history had a brief moment in the Hollywood spotlight with the release of the 1986 film ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Mission, ‚<U+0080>ù starring Robert De Niro. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was about building a different society, a kind of utopia with education, self-sustainability ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and of course, with music, which was the way the Jesuits evangelized, ‚<U+0080>ù said the Rev. Piotr Nawrot, a Roman Catholic priest from Poland who lives in Bolivia and was involved in recovering some of the original Baroque manuscripts. Overall, the Catholic Church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s record in the area was mixed; it agreed to force indigenous groups off many missions they had constructed to solve a territorial dispute between Spain and Portugal. Refusing to leave, some of the indigenous people fought a bloody war, and many of the churches fell into ruin. But among the lowland Bolivians, the legacy of Baroque music survived ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even centuries after indigenous communities lost the tradition of reading music, learning songs by ear. Advertisement To understand just how powerful the tradition remains today, consider Urubich√°, a farming village northwest of Concepci√≥n on the end of an unpaved dirt road bordering a swamp reached only after crossing ten bridges through dense jungle. The town of 8,000 has a music school teaching 500 students, nearly every child there. At lunchtime, children wander the village square toting instrument cases on their backs. They speak Guarayo, the native language. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Guarayo live with this music in their souls, ‚<U+0080>ù said Leidy Campos, 32, who teaches music in the village. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People say they were born with a violin in their hands.‚<U+0080>ù Across a field from the classrooms, Ideberto Armoye, a carpentry instructor, stood in a workshop of half-built violas and violins made from local cedar and mahogany. They were the only woods that could withstand the tropical heat, he said. To prove his point, he pulled out a violin that had come recently from a factory in China. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Anything happens to this instrument, look at this big crack, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. While many of the era‚<U+0080><U+0099>s songs had been passed down orally through families in Bolivia, the orchestrations and choral works were thought to be lost. For years it remained one of the mysteries of the time: While Baroque music had been the bridge between the Jesuits and Bolivians, no one knew exactly how it sounded.

In the 1990s, Father Nawrot went looking for what might have remained of the written music, a search that led him to the Moxos area further west. He asked village elders in the area about manuscripts of that time. But first, he said, they had questions for him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For three hours they questioned me about my faith, my religion, ‚<U+0080>ù Father Nawrot recalled. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was a complete reversal of roles.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Eventually the Moxos leaders revealed something that astounded him. Thousands of pages of manuscripts, including music from baroque operas to concertos for solo instruments, some of which had been copied as late as 2005, had survived. The copyists had even signed some of the scores ‚<U+0080><U+009C>maestro capilla, ‚<U+0080>ù a Baroque-era title used by composers like Johann Sebastian Bach. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The manuscript was never lost, we just didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know about it, ‚<U+0080>ù the priest said. Through much of the 1990s, Father Nawrot worked with Mr. Vaca, the archivist in Concepci√≥n, to reassemble another collection of scores that had been found in the 1970s, including the Zipoli manuscripts that had been eaten by termites. That body of work, which includes both copies of known works as well as unknown pieces written in Bolivia, is now known in classical music circles as Mission Baroque. The music has admirers well beyond the Bolivian lowlands. One is Ashley Solomon, a professor at the Royal College of Music in London who traveled to the city of Santa Cruz this April to conduct at a festival of baroque music held once each two years at the former Jesuit missions. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They took this music and made it their own ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s more upbeat, more positive, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Solomon said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The music lifts the soul, rather than self-flagellates, which is what you see in a lot of Western Classical music of the same time.‚<U+0080>ù And the pieces are shorter, Mr. Solomon said, written in bite-sized increments that more easily hold attention, which tends to wander more now than it did then. On a recent night not long after sunset, C√©sar Cara, the academic director at the music school in Urubich√°, led his student orchestra through a rehearsal of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sonata XVIII, ‚<U+0080>ù a score by an anonymous composer who wrote it somewhere in the surrounding hills in the 18th century. Advertisement A large insect crawled across the floor as the chorus waited their turn. One of the sopranos squashed it with her foot and kicked it toward the violins. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want people to applaud for us because of our level, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Cara said, noting that the students had recently played with a visiting group from the Juilliard School for one of the concerts in the festival. Mr. Solomon, the British musician, said the talent was strong in Bolivia. But he also said the villagers had a connection to the music that is rare in Europe, where classical music tends to live apart from popular culture. Mr. Solomon recalled years ago giving a concert in San Javier, west of Concepci√≥n and the site of a sprawling white-and-black Jesuit mission whose wood facade overlooks the main square. When his group, Florilegium, began to play an 18th-century flute concerto, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pastoreta Ychepe Flauta, ‚<U+0080>ù he was amazed, he said, to hear members of the audience, townspeople who knew the piece, humming the music too. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We could play Vivaldi‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Four Seasons‚<U+0080><U+0099> in London and no one would be singing along, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Solomon said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But in Bolivia people took the music for their own ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and got to the core essence of what music is about.‚<U+0080>ù Follow Nicholas Casey on Twitter: @caseysjournal."

Mr. Barbosa, 63, had joined the Brazilian Socialist Party in April, raising the prospect of a presidential bid. Even without declaring his candidacy, he was the choice of 10 percent of the respondents in a nationwide poll, thanks to his image as an anti-corruption crusader at a time when all of the major parties and many top politicians have been tainted by a wide-ranging bribery scandal. But on Tuesday, in a message on Twitter, he said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decided. After many weeks of reflection, I have finally reached a conclusion. I do not intend to be a candidate for the president of the Republic. Decision strictly personal.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It changes the entire scenario, ‚<U+0080>ù said Monica de Bolle, a Brazil expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Polarization wins the day.‚<U+0080>ù Former President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, who last month began serving a 12-year prison sentence after a corruption conviction, is leading in the polls, but he is likely to be barred from running. Next in line is Jair Bolsonaro, a congressman and ultraconservative former army captain who was recently charged with inciting racism. Advertisement According pollsters, Mr. Barbosa might have been able to unite voters on the left and the right because of his socially progressive agenda and his high-profile battle against corrupt politicians from Mr. da Silva‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Workers‚<U+0080><U+0099> Party during his years on the Supreme Court. Mr. Barbosa, the eldest of eight children, worked as a janitor in a courtroom before going on to become the only black student in his law school class at the University of Bras√≠lia. In 2003, he was appointed to the Supreme Court, where he oversaw the trial of politicians implicated in a vote-buying scheme. When he retired in 2014 he was approached by a number of political parties. This year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s presidential election will be the first since another corruption investigation, known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, engulfed the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s major political parties and landed Mr. da Silva in jail, convicted of receiving a luxury apartment as a bribe. Polls show that corruption is Brazilians‚<U+0080><U+0099> No. 1 concern heading into elections. Mr. Barbosa‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision not to run is likely to fuel the already deep divisions in Brazilian politics, but it will also open up space for candidates trying to seize the middle ground, in particular Marina Silva, a former environment minister who left the Workers‚<U+0080><U+0099> Party to create her own political movement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Marina Silva‚<U+0080><U+0099>s profile is very similar ‚<U+0080><U+0094> they even talked about forming a ticket together, although it never happened, ‚<U+0080>ù said Kennedy Alencar, a political columnist for CBN Radio, referring to Ms. Silva and Mr. Barbosa. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are both considered honest outsiders with a social commitment.‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Silva is the daughter of a rubber tapper and one of the few black Brazilians, along with Mr. Barbosa, to climb to the top of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s power structure. She has run unsuccessfully in two previous presidential elections, but this time her lack of ties to a major political party is an asset. Anger at the political establishment has lifted the prospects of outsiders like Mr. Barbosa and Mr. Bolsonaro, who was long regarded as a fringe legislator, but who has gathered momentum with his promises to stamp out corruption, make it easier to own guns and give the police a freer hand to fight crime. But there is another factor that could have a huge impact on what is becoming the most unpredictable election since the military dictatorship ended in the 1980s: Mr. da Silva. Advertisement After two terms, Mr. da Silva left office with an approval rating of 87 percent and even now, sitting behind bars, 30 percent of Brazilians say they would vote for him. His party insists that Mr. da Silva will be its candidate, but his candidacy is likely to be barred by the Supreme Electoral Court later this year. If he chooses to anoint a successor, his decision could tilt the race in his candidate‚<U+0080><U+0099>s favor, especially with Mr. Barbosa out of the race. Political analysts say Ciro Gomes, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Workers Party, could eventually form an alliance with Mr. da Silva‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Workers‚<U+0080><U+0099> Party, but so far he is trailing in the polls. Juliete Araujo, a 24-year-old house cleaner from the impoverished northeast, said it was hard to trust politicians other than Mr. da Silva, who is widely known as Lula. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lula is the only one who has ever cared about us, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Araujo said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe I would have voted for Joaquim Barbosa, but now if Lula isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t in the elections, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll just cast a blank ballot.‚<U+0080>ù"

Del Real,U.S.,US,"Opioids Opiates, Heroin, California, Rural area, Drug Abuse, Eureka CA, Hypodermic Needles and Syringes","EUREKA, Calif. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The dirty needles can be found scattered among the pine and brush, littering the forest floor around Eureka, a town long celebrated as a gateway to the scenic Redwood Empire. They are the debris of a growing heroin scourge that is gripping the remote community in Northern California. While the state as a whole has one of the lowest overall opioid-related death rates in the country, a sharp rise in heroin use across the rural north in recent years has raised alarms. In Humboldt County, the opioid death rate is five times higher than the state average, rivaling the rates of states like Maine and Vermont that have received far more national attention. The problem is exacerbated here in Eureka, the county seat, by a sizable homeless population that is growing amid an extreme lack of affordable housing and a changing, weakened economy that relies heavily on tourism. The combined ills have devastated a particularly vulnerable community that is often overlooked in the state. Now those problems are spilling into public view, sparking grievances and anger among the town‚<U+0080><U+0099>s residents. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve lost so many people to this, ‚<U+0080>ù said Stacy Cobine, 46, who has battled her own chaotic drug use and been chronically homeless. Intravenous drug use has been a persistent menace across rural California for decades, but longtime drug users who once sought methamphetamine ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which is also often injected ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are increasingly looking to score heroin or opioid pills instead. An astonishingly high rate of opioid prescription in Humboldt County has bred addiction, officials said, and the craving is increasingly sated by a growing market for heroin. Advertisement While meth ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is still king‚<U+0080>ù in Humboldt after decades of entrenched use, Ernie Stewart, the Chief Deputy Coroner at the County Sheriff‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Department, said he is certain that the county‚<U+0080><U+0099>s heroin-related overdoses are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>way underreported.‚<U+0080>ù He said meth and heroin abuse has touched every type of person locally, not just the homeless. With the sharp increases in use and overdoses, syringe litter has become a significant flash point for the town‚<U+0080><U+0099>s middle-class residents, particularly because tourism is so important for Eureka and the surrounding region. The town‚<U+0080><U+0099>s homeless have borne the brunt of the blame and frustration. Many Eurekans described various shocking experiences, including witnessing injections on public streets. They worry that discarded syringes could threaten children and tourists playing in the area‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parks. The Humboldt Area Center for Harm Reduction, which distributes clean needles through a syringe exchange program, has also drawn the ire of many in the community who blame the organization for the proliferation of needles. Brandie Wilson founded the organization in 2014 in part to combat the spread of hepatitis C, which is widespread in Humboldt County. The exchange, Ms. Wilson said, has distributed close to one million clean syringes since 2017. Data provided by Ms. Wilson showed that it gets about 94 percent of them back again. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our Hep C and mental health and drug use and homeless and opioid use issues, all of those are so intertwined with being rural, and with a culture of silence, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No matter where I looked, there was no help. There was no help.‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Wilson said the organization has also distributed thousands of kits of naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses. The needle litter problem intensified two years ago when the town removed a homeless encampment along the Palco Marsh where somewhere between 250 and 400 homeless people had been sleeping. City officials and health service workers had encouraged the town‚<U+0080><U+0099>s large homeless population for years to go there. The tent city, which was colloquially called Devil‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Playground, provided a place to sleep and to linger during the day, but it also saw severely unsanitary health conditions and, at times, violence. In 2016, the town decided to clear the camp to install a bike path along the water, and did not allow a new camp anywhere else. Now ‚<U+0080><U+009C>everybody wants to focus on syringes instead of lives, ‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Wilson.

Steve Shockley said he and other homeless people in the area do not just use meth recreationally: they often use it to stay awake at night. The homeless in town have fewer and fewer places where they can sleep without risking a ticket for loitering, or having their few possessions seized by the police. So they take meth to keep moving at night, and take heroin during the day to feed their cravings. Another homeless man, Michael Myers, said that heroin was easier to acquire than meth or on some days, even marijuana, which is surprising in a region known as the Emerald Triangle where marijuana is widely grown. If there has been a saving grace in Northern California, it is that a much more powerful illicit opioid, fentanyl, is far less common on the West Coast than in other parts of the country. Fentanyl, which is 50 times as strong as heroin, is increasingly being mixed into batches of heroin and is largely responsible for the devastating rise in opioid-related deaths nationally. Unlike the supply of heroin primarily found on the East Coast, the so-called Black Tar heroin seen in the West is harder to mix with fentanyl, according to public health experts. But even without fentanyl, Humboldt County is ill equipped to handle rising heroin abuse and addiction. Access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid abuse disorder is severely limited in these remote parts of California ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a problem shared by rural counties across the country. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The state is failing miserably, and you can quote me on that, ‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Stewart, the deputy coroner. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The state is failing miserably across the board. They are not putting enough funding and resources toward rehabilitation.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Mike McGuire, who represents several Northern California counties including Humboldt in the State Senate, said that government leaders needed to be more proactive about expanding resources in rural parts of the state. He said rural Californians are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>desperate‚<U+0080>ù for more assistance. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Humboldt County is just a few hours up Highway 101, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but as an individual travels further north on the highway, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like you take a step back in time. We need to step up to the plate and provide rural counties with the tools they need to combat this crisis.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McGuire said that between 500 and 700 residents of Humboldt and nearby Trinity and Del Norte counties are on a waiting list for opioid treatment services. Marlies Perez, the chief of the California Department of Health Care Services‚<U+0080><U+0099> Substance Use Disorder Compliance Division, said the state is working on increasing the number of treatment options available in rural areas. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One of the problems is stigma, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Perez said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have county supervisors who don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want a treatment program located in their area.‚<U+0080>ù Some options are on the way. The treatment provider Aegis is scheduled to assist in opening a center just outside Eureka by early 2019. The hub is meant to treat up to 200 patients and to serve as a center for smaller ‚<U+0080><U+009C>spoke‚<U+0080>ù centers in the region, including Del Norte and Trinity counties. Once there are more treatment options in place, the challenge will be getting the people who need them most to buy in, and to offer them mental health services as well. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Every time I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m almost off this‚<U+0080>ù stuff, said Mr. Shockley, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>somebody dies ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which is kind of a cop out. But it is what it is.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Ms. Cobine, for her part, believes that housing needs to be the priority in a comprehensive program to deal with drug use in the area. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know why treatment and rehab and these services always have to come into play first, ‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Cobine. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there was just affordable housing, people wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be using as much.‚<U+0080>ù Finding stable housing situations for those who are most vulnerable, to encourage recovery, is another challenge. Sally Hewitt of the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services said the county‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inability to expand public housing options will make that far more difficult, particularly because of local resistance. As a result of restrictions on public housing development in California, Ms. Hewitt said, county officials must largely deal with private landlords when seeking to house the homeless. Many of the landlords require potential tenants to have references, good credit and an income at least three times the cost of rent. Those are each obstacles for the homeless, particularly those with drug addictions. While the county seeks solutions to those systemic issues, Ms. Wilson said her organization will continue distributing needles in the region, despite opposition from town residents and despite efforts by the City Council to regulate her organization more heavily. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re just trying to figure out how to keep people alive while we wait for more treatment up here, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Wilson said."

Del Real, Inyoung Kang",U.S.,US,NA,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Hereís the sign-up.) Californiaís North Coast is known for its natural beauty and magnificent redwoods, but Eureka, the Humboldt County seat, is increasingly known for something else: the prevalence of dirty needles littering parks and public areas, crude remains of a heroin scourge that is afflicting the region. A sharp rise in heroin use has created intense fear among community members and public health officials in Humboldt County, even while California as a whole has one of the lowest overall opioid-related death rates in the country. In Humboldt County, opioid-related overdose rates are five times higher than in the rest of the state. Like rural areas around the country, the North Coast lacks sufficient treatment options to deal with opioid addiction. Today, it is increasingly difficult to find community members in Eureka who have not been touched by a surge of heroin use in the region. People have either lost loved ones, watched neighbors shrink into their addictions or come across the wave of needle litter left behind on sidewalks and in parks. Drug use in Humboldt County has many layers. Meth has been a scourge in rural California for many years, and because it is often shot intravenously, the transition to heroin has been too easy for many. Eurekaís large homeless population has been especially vulnerable to addiction in recent years. Discarded syringes have become a significant concern for the townís residents, who worry that the needles pose a threat to children and tourists. Those syringes are a symptom of a broader, systemic issue. Steve Shockley, a Eureka resident who is homeless, said he ìconvertedî to using heroin a few years ago after years of drug abuse. Like many other longtime intravenous drug users in the area, he now prefers heroin to meth, though he uses them both regularly. Stacy Cobine, who said she worked as a nurseís aide for many years, says that many drug users are getting abscesses from syringes; she said she had taught younger drug users proper needle technique to avoid infections and other complications. ìYou would not believe the dirty using practices Iíve seen,î she said. ìI just cringe thinking about it. Iíve had to teach a couple of my girlfriendsí kids how to do it right, help them do it, because it just made me so sad.î Read the full story here.

The plant was given its Latin name, Eschscholzia californica, by the French-born naturalist Adelbert von Chamisso, who visited the Bay Area in the early 19th century and studied its indigenous plants and animals. Mr. Chamisso returned to Europe, but the California State Floral Society chose the Eschscholzia californica as the state flower in 1890. In 1996, Gov. Pete Wilson declared May 13 to 18 as Poppy Week; in 2010, April 6 was designated California Poppy Day. Public schools and educational institutions are encouraged to conduct activities in honor of the state flower, including instruction on native plants and emphasizing conservation of natural resources.

Where do you stand?","Ben Kenigsberg, Jason Bailey",Movies,Entertainment,"Movies, Cannes Film Festival,, Netflix, Cannes","The Cannes Film Festival starts Tuesday already shadowed by controversy: organizers refused to show Netflix films in competition because they werenít getting theatrical releases. The streaming service responded by boycotting Cannes altogether, not even showing movies out of competition. The two organizations may resolve their differences (Netflix sounded more conciliatory last week), but moviegoers understandably want to know: Whatís the big deal? So we asked Ben Kenigsberg, who regularly reviews films for The Times, and Jason Bailey, who writes about streaming movies for The Timesís Watching service: Does it matter if you see a film in a theater or at home? BEN KENIGSBERG Absolutely, seeing a movie in a theater makes a difference, and not just for the obvious reasons (picture quality, sound, the absence of the distractions of home viewing). I challenge anyone to explain how the fluidity Steven Spielberg brings to the action in ìReady Player Oneî holds up at home. Lynne Ramsayís ìYou Were Never Really Hereî has imagery too dark and a sound design too layered for their full complexity to register on a TV, tablet or computer. And thatís to say nothing of the great screen spectacles ó ìLawrence of Arabia,î ì2001: A Space Odysseyî (reopening May 18) or, more recently, ìDunkirkî ó designed as overwhelming experiences. At their best, movies are also a social activity, and thatís as true today as in 1895. The hush that falls over a crowd during the largely dialogue-free ìA Quiet Placeî intensifies the suspense. Watching ìVertigoî in a theater for the umpteenth time last month, I heard gasps from viewers unfamiliar with its twists. And of course, there are all sorts of other reasons that going to the movies and home viewing arenít comparable. Spending an evening out spills over to other places, like restaurants and bars. JASON BAILEY The immersion, camaraderie and technical advantages of theatrical viewing are clearly preferable ó in theory. In practice, itís a different beast. And too often, those who most loudly advocate for preserving the magic of the theatrical experience arenít having the same experience as the average moviegoer; filmmakers, industry executives, and (yes) critics see movies for free, at premieres and festivals and media screenings, in spiffed-up venues, cozy private screening rooms, or even (gasp) fancy home cinemas. Regular audiences, on the other hand, shell out top dollar for a new release (often with surcharges for 3D, Imax and other superfluous bells and whistles). Theyíll see something like ìA Quiet Placeî in a packed multiplex, its spell broken by the sonic booms of ìPacific Rim: Uprisingî bleeding in from the next auditorium. And they may find themselves in a reserved seat next to a fellow moviegoer who chooses to spend those two hours answering texts and fave-ing pictures on Instagram. Is this always the case? No. But itís not uncommon. So who can blame a viewer who chooses to watch new movies, less expensively, in an environment they control? KENIGSBERG Thatís an argument for improving theaters (and moviegoersí behavior), not for avoiding them. Studios and major cinema owners deserve some blame for cheapening the theatrical experience. The last decadeís shift from film projection to digital has changed the way movies feel, transforming them into what Quentin Tarantino has called ìtelevision in public.î Even if the average viewer doesnít perceive the difference in texture, the conversion has still robbed movies of what was specific and tangible about a theatrical presentation. No, I canít blame anyone who prefers television in private. But well-run theaters are, as you say, still better; many of the best are independent or belong to smaller chains. Filmgoers should vote with their wallets. If you see a movie and the picture is bright, it sounds great and the staff kicks out smartphone users, go back. If the image is dim and text-messagers fiddle away with impunity, go somewhere else. Similarly, educate yourself on which extras are worthwhile. I made a point of seeing ìBlade Runner 2049î in a Dolby Cinema, knowing Iíd get some of the best digital projection around. By the way, my rapt viewing of ìA Quiet Placeî happened in an ordinary suburban multiplex. BAILEY Youíre right that itís on theaters and moviegoers to improve ó but these arenít exactly new complaints, and there doesnít seem to be much urgency to course correct. And sure, there are exceptions, but all too often, those indie houses and small chains are only options for moviegoers in larger markets. (And the same goes for 35-millimeter vs. digital projection, though I agree that itís more of a point of importance for cinephiles.) Honestly, the question of access is key to understanding the shift to streaming over the past several years. And not just access to theaters; I spent my first 30 years in Wichita, Kan., which is (to put it mildly) not among the first cities to get indies, documentaries or foreign films. So I would spend months hearing about those kinds of movies before they finally made their way to a theater where I could see them, if ever ó most, I would see on video, six-plus months later. Now, those movies are frequently available on demand or on Netflix at the same time as their limited theatrical release. Netflix movies may not get to play in competition at Cannes, but my movie-crazy cousin back home can see them the same day I can. Or he can go to his multiplex, where ìAvengers: Infinity Warî is on two-thirds of the screens. I know which he prefers. KENIGSBERG I hear the access argument often, but that access is at least partly a mirage. Of the 30 most acclaimed movies so far this year, according to the review aggregation site Metacritic, only three that have opened in theaters (ìPaddington 2,î the Hungarian Oscar contender ìOn Body and Soulî and the Estonian folk tale ìNovemberî) are available to stream (as of this writing). If we add in movies that opened in 2017 or earlier, the appropriate point of comparison is not theaters but the video stores that the streaming services replaced. Netflixís ìclassicsî movies section ó around 30 films ó might not have passed muster at a Blockbuster. If you want to see ìLean on Pete,î ìWhere Is Kyra?î or any of the reputedly excellent indie films I have on my to-watch list, home viewing is not much help, at least for now. Maybe that will change, you say. But as Netflix has gained market share, it has reduced the number of movies it has offered, which doesnít inspire confidence in it or other companiesí eagerness to bring obscure titles to the heartland. In any case, itís not clear why that goal is incompatible with having theaters. BAILEY Thereís no doubt that the Netflix model is deeply, deeply flawed, both in terms of its laughable ìclassicsî selection and the speed with which many contemporary independent films crawl to the service. Netflixís priorities mostly favor its original series, but I maintain that far more viewers saw ìMudbound,î ìOkjaî and ìThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),î and far more quickly, than if those movies had received more conventional releases. And even films that still go the theatrical route are available for home viewing sooner (the delay has shrunk to 90 days or less), which means audiences end up venturing out to theaters only for movies that seem like essential ìbig-screenî viewing. Thereís certainly room for both. What seems clear is that at this point, studios, distributors and streaming services have to figure out a way to coexist. The choice between a genuinely immersive outing to a theater and an affordable, user-friendly experience at home could (and should) be a difficult one. At this particular moment, itís usually not."
67,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,5:00:12,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/travel/chile-route-of-parks-52-places.html,"In Chile, a Gorgeous, Very Rainy and Sometimes Lonely Journey","Though she only got to see part of Chileís Route of Parks, our columnist found plenty of joy ó and solitude.",Jada Yuan,Travel,Lifestyle,"Chile, Travel;Tourism, Patagonia Chile, National Parks and National Monuments, Hiking, Volcano","Our columnist, Jada Yuan, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2018 list. This dispatch brings her to Chile, where she explores a section of the Route of Parks, a trail that will eventually connect 17 of the countryís national parks; it took the No. 6 spot on the list and is the 11th stop on Jadaís itinerary. Ten minutes into my drive down the dirt highway that transects Chileís Parque PumalÌn in northern Patagonia, I had to pull over. Not for any mechanical reason, just to stand and stare in awe. Dense forest had suddenly given way to a lake flanked by mountains ó a Chia pet landscape of undulating greenery beneath a vivid blue sky streaked with cirrus clouds. Minutes later, I came to another screeching stop. This time at a rocky stream overrun with gunnera plants, otherwise known as Chilean rhubarb or dinosaur food, for having leaves so enormous they could wrap my 5-foot-6 frame like a burrito. Iíd seen one or two gunnera earlier in my Chile stay, in the rain forest of Alerce Andino, the northernmost entry on the Route of Parks (named after the towering, ancient alerce, or larch, trees that are like Chileís redwoods). But to walk among the gunnera in abundance, amid mountains untouched by human hands, felt like stepping into a time machine. ìThis is just like Jurassic Park,î I whispered, to no one. My 50-mile trip south through PumalÌn should have clocked in at around an hour. It took me four. That meandering was spiked with so much joy. But it was also the first time, in two and a half months of solo travel, that I have felt truly lonely. Thereís nothing like shouting out, ìThis is so beautiful!î to an empty car to make you wish for company. THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAY Ever since I saw the list of destinations for my yearlong 52 Places trip, the Route of Parks had been emblazoned in my mind: ìRoad trip!î Technically, the ìrouteî is a rebranding of a portion of Chileís epic Southern Highway, or Carretera Austral, which stretches from the industrial city of Puerto Montt in the north to the skinny tip of the country in the south. As part of that, this January, the Chilean government signed an accord with the nonprofit Tompkins Conservation to place an additional 10 million acres of combined public and private parkland under its protection. The goal is to create a 1,500-mile adventure-tourism trail that would be unmatched in the world. Right now, though, itís a road with a hodgepodge of opportunities to fend for oneself in all kinds of wilderness. And that, of course, is the appeal. Large swaths of it were unpaved and under construction and full of potholes from intense, constant dumps of rain. Gas, cell signal and fellow humans are sparse as it snakes between beaches and the Andes, across fjords and through rain forests. Most international backpackers I met had started in the far south at the Routeís famed, glacier-filled Torres del Paine. With the help of the travel writer Stephanie Dyson, I chose to head the opposite way (as do many Chileans traveling from Santiago) and maximize my time in PumalÌn ó a former private park that the government recently took over as part of the Tompkins accord. Itís also relatively accessible from Puerto Montt via the Carretera Austral. Which is to say it took me nine hours just to get to the entrance, four driving along stunning coastline and five more on three fjord-crossing ferries. Iíd do it all again, except for the part where the dirt highway disappeared and all that was left was a ditch filled with mud and boulders that made horrifying sounds as they scraped the bottom of my rental car. DEALING WITH THE DELUGE ChaitÈn, the quaint seaside town that served as my base in the park, is a backpackerís depot for PumalÌn and destinations south, hosting arrivals by bus and infrequent ferry. Hostels abound, but my lodging, Hotel Mi Casa, seemed like an outlier, a Germanic chalet up a forest road I only found through quizzing children playing soccer on unmarked streets. If there is a single stoplight, I donít remember seeing it. Ten years ago, the entire settlement had to be evacuated when the adjacent Volc·n ChaitÈn erupted unexpectedly for the first time in over 9,000 years. Stalwarts moved back and rebuilt, but thereís still a ghostly row of collapsed houses on the street closest to the mountains. It wasnít lava that caused the destruction, though, but a mudslide of volcanic ash triggered by rain, which I experienced as a biblical deluge four of my five days in PumalÌn. The name of ChaitÈn means ìbasket of waterî in the native language of Huilliche. ìWhat do you do when it rains like this?î I asked Federico Lynam, the owner of Hotel Mi Casa. ìThe same thing we always do,î he said. ìWe work hard, we eat our meals. If we stopped doing anything because it rained, nothing would ever get done.î One day, exploring ChaitÈnís cemetery of houses during a rare moment of sunshine, I found myself in a field, where a brown horse munched on grass next to a brown leather La-Z-Boy. Just beyond them was a building that looked exactly like where Iíd go if I wanted to get killed in the post-apocalypse. The gunnera plants in the front lawn were so overgrown that they reached the roof, a colony of Audrey IIís from ìLittle Shop of Horrors.î Graffiti covered every wall, and the blue bars on the doors and broken windows, plus many tiny rooms with many tiny toilets, seem to confirm that Iíd wandered into an abandoned prison. Then the rain returned, flowing through holes in the roof as if from a sprinkler. I wasnít scared, yet, just cold. I posted a tweet, mainly to create a record of where I was. Half an hour passed, then an hour. The rain wouldnít let up and now my phone was dead and the dayís light was beginning to fade. I could see my car in the far distance. The wind was gusting with such force that the rainfall rose off the pavement in waves. I took a deep breath and ran. Water flew up my nose and soaked my socks, which wouldnít dry for days ó and I was laughing. Laughing and running. And there was my car but I didnít open the door. I wanted to stand there, getting wet, taking it in. THE FRIENDS YOU MEET ON VOLCANOES Determined to get in one hike in the window of what looked like a rain-free day, I set off on the three-hour round trip trail up Volc·n ChiatÈn. I hadnít counted on quite how remote and steep it would be. A sea of burned sticks that were trees before the 2008 eruption towered above a undergrowth of ferns. My pace was so slow that people whoíd passed me on their way up were lapping me on their way down. I realized I hadnít told anyone where I was, and hadnít had a cell signal for days. All I had in my backpack was photo equipment, two liters of water and a packet of salami. Then the rain began again, coming down so hard it flowed off every plant in mini-waterfalls. I wondered who would notice I was missing (probably my mom) and how long it would take to find my body. By the time I crested the top of the volcano, a moonscape of ash and the charred remains of what must have once been grand alerces, three hours had passed. All of my photographic equipment failed at once. Chilly cloud cover had made my fingers numb. And I still had to hike down. A lone figure in a black hoodie emerged from the clouds, and we circled each other silently before I finally asked him if he spoke Spanish or English. He broke into a huge grin: English. His name was Manuel Knoche, a 33-old Berliner who had been traveling for six months. He, too, was a little lonely and ill-prepared: he had hitchhiked to the wrong volcano, had walked two hours on the highway to get to this one, and had no idea how he was going to get back. I had a car, I told him. If he was willing to walk at my slow pace, Iíd be happy to give him a lift. He said sure. The clouds cleared for a minute, revealing a barren red-dirt mountaintop. Then they came back, bringing hail. On the way down, Mr. Knoche and I had plenty of time to talk. He had spent his 20s playing drums in and managing punk rock bands. He was on a yearlong sabbatical from his job as a social worker. By the time weíd gotten down the mountain, we had plans for dinner (at Chaitenís surprisingly good Pizzeria Reconquista) and to keep traveling together for the rest of the time I had in Chile. Iíll spoil the ending now: nothing romantic happened, and we still WhatsApp across separate continents. ìI was a journalist, he was a German punk rock drummer. We met in a hailstorm on a volcano in Chile,î is a pretty good start to a rom com, though. THE WAY STATION THAT BECAME A HOME My jaunts through the rain-soaked parks were stunning but wore me down. Puerto Varas, a small city north of Puerto Montt, was the antidote. Located on Lago Llanquihue, Chileís second largest lake, and filled with charming Germanic architecture, it reminded me of an Alpine ski village magically transported waterside. Shops for outdoor gear (I bought hiking boots) and delicious restaurants abound. (Try CasavaldÈs, La Marca, Casa Mawen and Mesa Tropera.) Some find the city bougie, and it is. Itís also pleasant and cosmopolitan and easy in a way that made me feel like I could relax. And Iím not alone. I met a woman from San Francisco whoíd gone there for a year and stayed for several more. Her father liked being there so much that he bought a dairy farm heís converting to a nut farm. I had taken a full-day guided hike to Alerce Andino from there before PumalÌn and convinced Mr. Knoche to come back with me so we could check out the rest of the Los Lagos Region. Our travel styles were certainly different, but I admired his ability to wake up every morning with a sunny attitude, and an openness to what the day might bring him. One day, he went for a walk and brought back a friend, Lukas Lencak from Slovakia, whom Mr. Knoche had met earlier when they were both backpacking in Argentina. Mr. Lencak was a 31-year-old service engineer whoíd quit his job to travel. Like us, he had arrived at Puerto Varas on a whim and couldnít bring himself to leave. Two days had turned into six. ìItís just so nice here,î he said, echoing what all of us seemed to feel. Long-term travel is an amazing privilege with exhilarating returns, and exhausting side effects. Hold onto the places and people that let you breathe. PRACTICAL TIPS You donít need a four-by-four to drive the Carretera Austral, but be prepared for your rental car to take a beating ó which is why most companies require a $1,500 credit card deposit. (Or take a one-way rental with Wicked Campers, like a Colorado family I met.) Ask for directions once on the ground and carry written maps; Google Maps and cell signal are both unreliable. Ferries are often the only way to drive to a given park. Book well in advance and pay particular attention to schedules. Alternatively, buses are affordable and plentiful. Just watch your stuff. Mr. Lencak told me heíd met 10 to 12 people whoíd traveled through Puerto Montt and three of them had been robbed. You have heard about Chilean wine, but Patagonia is beer (and pisco sour) country. Start with CervecerÌa Austral and try everything else. The best thing I ate was at the dive restaurant Cocineria El Comedor in ChaitÈn, a hearty stew of beef, carrots and potatoes called carbonada, perfect for those (seemingly always) rainy days. Short on time? Base yourself in Puerto Varas and take day trips to the Los Lagos region. Start with a full-day guided hike through Alerce Andino. Another day, tackle the trifecta of Lago Todos los Santos (a cheap half-hour boat ride), PetrohuÈ Waterfalls and a sunset drive up Volc·n Osorno. (Set off early and you can hit all three.) All of the walks are easy enough for children and grandparents alike. Not a hiker? Sendero de Alerce in Parque PumalÌn is an a short, flat walk through an amazing alerce grove. Afterward, head to Termas de Amarillo, a set of swimming-pool-like hot springs set in the rain forest south of ChaitÈn. The road is, of course, impossible to find. Going while itís raining is double the fun. Jada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this yearís 52 Places to Go list.

A young woman in a traditional Chinese dress stared out from the attached photos. Age: 29. Build: Thin. Hair: Dark. Nationality: Chinese. The document permitted Mrs. Leanforeís great-grandmother, Yuck Land Hing, to come and go from Australia at a time when the White Australia Policy kept out most Asian immigrants. It was a limited reprieve ó a three-year exemption to the dictation test commonly used to exclude nonwhite immigrants. ìWe suffered,î Mrs. Leanfore said as she looked at the photo, recalling the first in a long line of her relatives who emigrated to Australia. ìBut we didnít do anything wrong.î This year commemorates 200 years of Chinese migration to Australia. The anniversary comes at a time when Australia is once again conflicted about its relationship with the regionís biggest, most powerful country, and many Chinese Australians are digging into their familiesí archives to share their history with audiences from both China and Australia. Februaryís Lunar New Year celebrations in Sydney featured talks from local historians. Chinese-Australian history museums are planning new exhibitions that connect the story of the Australiaís earliest Chinese immigrants to its newest, and community organizations are hosting regular talks around Chinese figures in Australian history. Even in smaller towns and cities like Bendigo, where the Golden Dragon Museum has successfully raised money to replace its historic ceremonial Qing dynasty dragon, Chinese Australians are actively seeking ways to keep their culture alive. Those who are involved say these activities are an effort to define their community on its own terms, separate from debates over the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in Australia, and to ensure that the public understands that not everyone who looks Chinese in Australia is a new arrival. ìI think people, especially white people, lump us all as Chinese, as if everybody is the same,î said Teik Hock Lim, 67, an ethnic Chinese, retired social worker, who grew up in Malaysia under British rule. ìItís like if people would call all white people the same.î [Sign up for the Australia Letter to get conversation starters about Australia and global stories that matter in your inbox each week.] Australiaís relationship to Chinese immigration has always zigzagged between rejection and acceptance. In 1818, Mak Sai Ying, a young man from Guangdong, stepped off a ship in Port Jackson, becoming one of the first recorded Chinese immigrants to the continent. Given the Anglicized name John Shying, he became a well-known pub owner in Sydneyís west. When gold was discovered in the 1850s, a wave of new migrants from around the world arrived to try their luck, including thousands of Chinese men from Canton. Out on the goldfields, competition for riches meant tension simmered between European and Chinese miners. Riots broke out; in one instance, a mob of 3,000 European miners burned a Chinese camp. To discourage immigration, Victorian ports levied a heavy tax on Chinese miners. But the most resolved disembarked at South Australian ports and made the 500 km (310 mile) trek to the goldfields on foot. Not all survived. Australiaís first federal parliament went on to pass legislation in 1901 that would require all immigrants to pass a 50-word dictation test to enter the country. Because the test was enacted to keep nonwhite immigrants out, there was an insidious twist: officials could test applicants in any European language. After a while, ìthere was never a Chinese person who could pass it,î said Daphne Lowe Kelley, a community leader and former President of the Chinese Heritage Association of Australia. Unable to enter Australia in the 1920s, Ms. Lowe Kelleyís father sailed to New Zealand instead, paying a tax to settle there. Those of Chinese descent who were already in the country, like Mrs. Leanforeís great-grandmother, could apply for an exemption from the test in order to travel. But many, with families still living in China, simply gave up and returned home, including Mrs. Leanforeís grandmother who returned to Guangzhou. In the decades following 1901, the Chinese population declined. Race-based policies remained in place until 1973, when the government heralded a policy of multiculturalism. Now there are about 1.2 million people in Australia with Chinese ancestry. For years, older Chinese Australians have nursed the painful legacy of the White Australia Policy. Now, after 200 years, they see their community as a patchwork of experiences. It includes the descendants of Cantonese and Hakka migrants from the Gold Rush era, ethnic Chinese refugees who fled the Vietnam War, migrants from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and mainland China who have arrived steadily since the 1980s, and most recently ó an influx of Chinese international students. Nick Shying, 22, is one of many Chinese Australians whose roots reach back to that first Chinese settler ó despite his pale skin and blue eyes. He said people often laugh when he brings up his Chinese heritage. Australians still use appearance as a basis for ethnic assumptions, he said, ìbut here I am as an example of the potential flaws of taking that approach.î Many community leaders say these nuanced identities are once again being overlooked and oversimplified as the public focuses on new waves of immigration. Part of the reason may be that Australia still considers itself a white nation, said Kate Bagnall, a historian at the University of Wollongong. ìThatís a really powerful image thatís really difficult to shift,î she said. And with the Australian government fending off allegations of political interference from the Chinese government, some worry this ignorance of history will spur an anti-Chinese backlash. ìThere are some of us in the community who feel this is shades of the White Australia Policy coming back again,î said Ms. Lowe Kelley, a former president of the Chinese Heritage Association. She added that when she reads news singling out Chinese political donations and investment, she worries that it will filter down: ìWhat happens is it tars the whole of the Chinese community.î Of the many Chinese Australian historical organizations she has been involved with, none receive funding from the Chinese government, she said. Others involved in the revival of Chinese Australian history also said they steer clear of Chinese officialdom. Mark Wang, the deputy chairman of the Museum of Chinese Australian History in Melbourne said the goal is to remain impartial, relying on state government funding, ticket sales and community donations. ìWe donít want to be distorted by a political undercurrent,î Mr. Wang said. ìWeíre about Australian history. Weíre not about Chinese history.î For families closest to that history, the past is a bittersweet mystery that should never stop being reinterpreted and retold. Mrs. Leanforeís son, Ken, 31 is a photographer. Tired of fielding questions about his unusual last name, he recently curated an exhibition using stories of Chinese Australians with names that were Anglicized by immigration officers. On a recent afternoon, in the family home her ancestors bought in 1928, Mrs. Leanfore sipped tea with her husband and son, as a pack of grandchildren chased each other through the house. ìNone of them are pure Chinese,î said Mrs. Leanfore, smiling. ìBut thatís what the future is going to be.î"

If you sit at the communal table long enough and gaze up at the honeycomb-patterned ceiling, you just might notice the lights shifting between different shades of white. They, too, are meant to contribute to your well-being, by delivering optimal brightness and color temperature at different times of day. Honeybrains is an early adopter of a technology that is becoming the next frontier in LEDs: circadian lighting. Just a few years ago, manufacturers of LEDs were struggling to replicate the static warm glow of incandescent bulbs; now most are experimenting with products that offer a range of color temperatures, mimicking the brilliant midday sun, the gentle lapping of candlelight and all the shades and intensities in between. The benefits, lighting companies say, include interiors with happier vibes and improved sleep and overall health for the people who spend time in them. Circadian rhythms are still mysterious enough to whet the intellectual appetites of scientists. In fact, the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to researchers who identified molecular mechanisms that control the process. Circadian lighting aims to keep the bodyís internal clock aligned with the 24-hour diurnal/nocturnal cycle by emitting bright bluish light during the day to suppress the melatonin that our brains produce as a natural sleep aid. As evening approaches, the system switches to dim yellowish light, allowing the hormone to flow freely. ìWhether people are ready for it or not, itís happening and coming,î said Natalia Lesniak, a senior lighting designer at Lumen Architecture, the New York firm that worked with Vamos Architects to create the lighting for Honeybrains. ìItís like green building 10 years ago ó itís going to become the default,î said Ms. Lesniak. ìAnd LEDs are the technological advantage that are allowing us to do it.î Acuity Brands, Cree, Osram, Philips, USAI Lighting and other companies have introduced what they call tunable or dynamic white LED light fixtures, most of which are intended for offices and other commercial spaces. Philipsís marketing materials say these products even deliver ìa stimulus similar to a strong cup of coffeeî during the workday. Many are playing catch-up to Ketra, an eight-year-old brand in Austin, Tex., that works exclusively on circadian lighting systems ó or what it calls ìnatural light.î Ketraís bulbs and fixtures can be found in Whole Foods Market at Bryant Park in New York, the offices of Squarespace and Vice Media, Manhattanís TMPL gym, the Art Institute of Chicago, and, yes, restaurants like Honeybrains. ìThe lighting we want when itís bright outside is fundamentally different than what we want when itís dark outside,î said Nav Sooch, Ketraís chief executive. ìWe concluded that what the world needed was lighting that would adapt for the situation and the time of day.î Ketra started out illuminating commercial spaces, but expanded into the residential market last year, and was acquired by the lighting controls company Lutron last month. Its products can now be operated by Amazon Alexa and Lutron devices, in addition to its own controls and mobile app. The brand sells whole-home systems through audiovisual specialists, with prices from about $5 to $15 per square foot. Ketra bulbs have red, green, blue and white LEDs inside, as well as sensors that monitor and adjust them to achieve desired light levels and colors throughout the day. Color temperatures range from about 1,400 to 10,000 kelvin. (For comparison, the color temperature of candlelight is below 2,000 kelvin, traditional incandescent bulbs are roughly 2,700 to 3,000, and natural daylight can be well over 5,000.) The brandís primary goal is nuanced whites, but when itís party time, the products also can bathe rooms in a rainbow of bright colors. For those who want to try circadian lighting on a smaller scale, GE Lighting offers C-Sleep retrofit bulbs (less than $50 a pair from online retailers) and the C by GE Sol lamp (less than $150 purchased online), which similarly change color temperature at different times of the day, and are controllable through an app and virtual voice assistants. ìPart of the original premise was around wellness and bringing people the ability to influence their quality of sleep by manipulating the quality of light theyíre exposed to,î said Jeff Patton, the general manager of connected home product management at GE Lighting. ìMore companies are doubling down in this area because itís a real benefit to consumers and has implications to our overall quality of life.î Many studies in recent years have identified health benefits from circadian lighting strategies. A 2017 study by the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in partnership with the United States General Services Administration, for instance, found that office workers exposed to bright bluish light during the day fell asleep faster at bedtime, enjoyed better sleep quality and reported lower levels of stress and depression than those who did not. The deleterious effects of sleep loss are also well documented. In 2006, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) Committee on Sleep Medicine and Research published a report citing numerous studies that associated sleep loss with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression. The Lighting Research Center has partnered with the United States Navy to test circadian lighting in submarines; it has collaborated with Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to evaluate the lightís use in recovery rooms for transplant patients; and it has worked with the National Institute on Aging to increase the comfort of people suffering from Alzheimerís disease. However, Mariana G. Figueiro, the director of the Lighting Research Center, warned that homeowners swapping out a few bulbs shouldnít expect the same results as participants in a controlled study. ìIím afraid that some manufacturers are overstating the benefits,î she said. ìWe caution people that you really need to measure to make sure that you are delivering the circadian stimulus that you need to. Your eyes alone wonít tell you whether youíre delivering the right amount of light.î To help, the center has developed a metric for evaluating lighting strategies called Circadian Stimulus, as well as an online calculator for estimating the effects of lighting products. The user of this tool, however, will encounter terms like ìmacular pigment optical density,î ìvertical photopic illuminanceî and ìspectral power distribution,î indicators that itís probably best left to professional lighting designers. Another impediment to effective circadian lighting is that few people spend their days in confined environments. We are exposed to wildly different light conditions as we move between city streets, vehicles and offices, and gaze at smartphones, computers and televisions. ìThe important thing about circadian lighting is that itís really a 24-hour light-dark pattern,î Dr. Figueiro said. ìIf I donít know what else youíre being exposed to over the rest of the day, I canít guarantee itís going to be beneficial.î Health advantages aside, the promise of consistently pleasant light has been enough to win over some converts. ìFor us, itís really more about the feel-good factor,î said Suzan Tillotson, president of the New York lighting design firm Tillotson Design Associates. ìWe understand that when itís dark outside, you really want a warmer light. Bright blue light doesnít feel good after the sun has set.î Thatís one reason Ms. Tillotson used 10,000 Ketra bulbs in her lighting scheme for the new 134,000-square-foot Manhattan headquarters of the advertising and design agency R/GA, where the lights cycle between warm and cool white over the day, but also beam colors for special events and to identify different conference rooms. ìThe results have been very favorable,î said David Boehm, the executive vice president of global facilities at R/GA. ìWe havenít quantified it, but because the lighting is so adaptive, I think itís helped people endure long days in what can be a very straining kind of environment ó that is, being in front of monitors or presentations all day long.î One piece of evidence in support of the technology is that employees no longer unscrew bulbs from ceiling fixtures or amass piles of their own lamps to create comfortable lighting at their desks. ìIím not sure that people even realize itís there,î Mr. Boehm said. And that is perhaps the ultimate compliment ó the same could be said about daylight on a sunny afternoon."

On Tuesday, a coalition of national and Texas-based housing groups are expected to file suit in Federal District Court in Washington to reinstate an Obama-era rule that required localities receiving federal development funding to submit plans detailing their efforts to end segregation based on race, income, ethnicity or physical disability. Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, suspended the rule, known as the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing provision, this year over concerns that it put too heavy a burden on local governments that would have to allocate resources to produce the plans. The advocates filing the lawsuit argue that Mr. Carsonís actions violated the 1968 Housing Act, a law that was pressed by Martin Luther King Jr. shortly before his assassination. The suit claims that Mr. Carson is leaving HUD without a system to prevent a pattern of discrimination in the allocation of $28 billion in disaster relief funding after a succession of natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey, last year. The fight centers on an affirmative fair housing rule put in place in 2015 after two years of study and public hearings. At the time, Julian Castro, Mr. Carsonís predecessor as HUD secretary, said the regulation would ìprovide all Americans with access to safe, affordable housing in communities that are rich with opportunity.î But housing advocates say the administration has not followed through with ensuring equitable treatment in housing, and they are concerned that HUD may discriminate against vulnerable populations when awarding funds to reconstruct areas damaged by natural disasters. Lisa Rice, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance, one of the groups bringing the suit, said the litigation was intended to prevent racial bias in the reconstruction of housing, drainage systems and other infrastructure. The group wants to ensure that black, Hispanic and low-income residents of Houston and Corpus Christi are not put at risk in the event of another natural disaster. ìThis is the fight Dr. King envisioned, even 50 years later,î Ms. Rice said. Madison Sloan, director of Texas Appleseedís Disaster Recovery & Fair Housing Project, another plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the suit was about not leaving people behind. ìWe know that disasters have a disparate impact on the most vulnerable populations, especially communities of color,î she said. ìHistorically, segregation has forced these communities into the areas most vulnerable to natural disasters. We have to make sure we are rebuilding in a way that remedies, rather than perpetuates, these inequalities.î A HUD spokesman did not return a call for comment. Mr. Carson has said he delayed the rule to give localities more time to comply. But his previous comments suggest a lack of affinity for the provision. In a 2015 editorial in the conservative Washington Times, Mr. Carson criticized the effort in sweeping ideological terms, calling it ìsocial engineering,î and predicted that its enforcement would repeat ìthe failure of school busingî in the 1970s. Mr. Carson, during testimony before congressional committees last month, said he intended to comply with other department regulations requiring that the majority of disaster relief funding be directed to those most in need. But he gave little ground on the Obama-era provision when he met with fair housing advocates late last month by rejecting their calls to reinstate the rule. Some department officials said Mr. Carsonís efforts at HUD so far include slowing enforcement actions and investigations of some fair housing violations. Housing segregation has long been an issue for HUD and has landed previous secretaries in the cross hairs. George Romney, the first HUD secretary, clashed with President Richard M. Nixon when he tried to withhold federal funding for sewer, highway, water and infrastructure projects in areas that encouraged segregation. Mr. Nixon blocked the program, known as ìOpen Communities.î Mr. Romney, the father of the former Republican presidential candidate and current Utah Senate candidate Mitt Romney, forged ahead with the plan and was eventually ejected from the cabinet."

Her memoir, ìThe Girl Who Smiled Beads,î recounts her journey.",Alexis Okeowo,Books,Lifestyle,"Books, Clemantine Wamariya,,, War Crimes Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity, Refugees;Internally Displaced People, Rwanda","THE GIRL WHO SMILED BEADS A Story of War and What Comes After By Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth Weil 276 pp. Crown Publishers. $26. In stories of war, there is supposed to be an order to things, a standard narrative with stock characters. During the fighting, there are perpetrators (warlords, rebels, governments) and victims (innocent civilians who wind up hurt or killed). There are also refugees, who find shelter in camps, thanks to intervening aid workers. After the fighting ends, the refugees are often left with nothing and sometimes no one, but they piece their lives back together, relieved to have survived and, especially if they are fortunate enough to make it to the United States, eager to begin anew. After the Rwandan genocide in 1994, Clemantine Wamariya became one of those refugees. At 6, she and her older sister, Claire, fled their grandmotherís home in Butare, near the Burundi border, to avoid killers. The siblings wound up traversing seven African countries on their own for more than six years, moving from refugee camps to slums to satellite settlements and back to camps, as they searched for a stable existence. In her sharp, moving memoir, ìThe Girl Who Smiled Beads,î Wamariya and her co-author, Elizabeth Weil, a writer at large for The Times Magazine, describe Wamariyaís idyllic early childhood in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, and the madness that followed with an analytic eye and, at times, a lyrical honesty. ìItís strange, how you go from being a person who is away from home to a person with no home at all,î they write. ìYou are unwanted, by everyone.î But Wamariya was not ìa nice poor African refugee girl,î the authors assert; she was angry, bitter, suspicious of kindness. The war she survived fit no traditional narrative. Neighbors in Rwanda ó the innocent civilians ó turned on one another with astonishing brutality; the violence may have ended after 100 days, but trauma lingered. The pain and daily humiliations endured by Clemantine and Claire, as they struggled to hold on to their dignity and stay alive, shaped Wamariyaís outlook and choices long after she moved to Chicago to start a new life. At her first camp, in Burundi, she struggled to stay fed, clean, healthy. In a refugee camp, ìothers were invested in your suffering,î the authors write. ìTheir jobs and self-worth depended on your continued abasement, on your commitment to residing in a social stratum below them, the same old neocolonial scheme.î Wamariya was constantly preoccupied with the question of survival. (ìI was the most tired 11-year-old in the world,î she recalls.) Adapting to a new environment became a skill: figuring out how to blend in, how to get by. But she and her sister were routinely forced to leave a refuge just when they got comfortable, prompted by violence or a sense that life was better elsewhere. ìAll that night we walked,î she says of one hasty departure. ìI felt such rage. Iíd finally mastered my life here. Ö And now we were walking away.î Nothing was easy. Even Wamariyaís relationship with Claire, who at 15 assumed the role of her guardian, was achingly strained. Their mutual resentment, tangled with love, made Wamariyaís journey all the more isolating. ìNobody in my world was tender and protective of me anymore,î she says. ìCertainly not Claire.î The sections of the book describing the sistersí search for safety in Rwanda are told in impressionistic sketches from a 6-year-oldís point of view: a confusion of unknown menaces and destinations. Only later do we learn the specifics of the mass killings. The technique doesnít fully work when the narrative turns to Wamariyaís stay in a lakeside town in Zaire ó later the Democratic Republic of Congo ó initially a happy period, beautifully detailed in the book, that descends into terror when that country, too, erupts into conflict. The passages on war here are vague, a litany of violence and despair presented without context or explanation. Yet Wamariya is piercing about her alienation in America and her effort to combat the perception that she is an exotic figure, to be pitied or dismissed. (A mention of her difficult relationships with African-Americans is disappointingly left unexplored.) She says that she lacked a language to recount her story until she read Elie Wieselís Holocaust memoir, ìNightî: ìI was fascinated by Wieselís determination to view himself without pity, shame or sentimentality, to spell out the horrors he lived through and place himself in the fallen world.î Wamariya tells her own story with feeling, in vivid prose. She has remade herself, as she explains was necessary to do, on her own terms."

Critical threats to democracy have also surfaced in countries like Turkey, Brazil and the Philippines. Under President Trumpís ìAmerica Firstî orientation, leaders with authoritarian tendencies in places as disparate as Egypt, Honduras, Russia and Venezuela have trampled their political opponents without concern for anything more harmful than a tongue lashing from the United States. Why do democracies backslide toward authoritarianism? Many scholars point to the worrisome erosion of democratic norms rooted in a social consensus about the rules of the game and civility toward fellow citizens. But this erosion of democratic norms is ultimately driven by deeper factors. In many democracies, the roots of breakdown reside in democratic constitutions themselves. Over two-thirds of countries that have transitioned to democracy since World War II have done so under constitutions written by the outgoing authoritarian regime. Prominent examples include Argentina, Chile, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and South Korea. Even some of the worldís early democracies, such as the Netherlands and Sweden, were marred by deep authoritarian legacies. Democratic institutions are frequently designed by the outgoing authoritarian regime to safeguard incumbent elites from the rule of law and give them a leg up in politics and economic competition after democratization. The constitutional tools that outgoing authoritarian elites use to accomplish these ends include factors like electoral system design, legislative appointments, federalism, legal immunities, the role of the military in politics and constitutional tribunal design. In short, the allocation of power and privilege, and the lived experiences of citizens, democracy often does not restart the political game after displacing authoritarianism. Furthermore, barriers to changing the social contract in countries that inherit constitutions from a previous authoritarian regime are steep. These constitutions often contain provisions requiring supermajority thresholds for change. And elites from the authoritarian past who benefit from these constitutions utilize their power to pass policies that further entrench their privileges. Myanmar is a prime example of how outgoing authoritarian regimes can game democracy in their favor. The 2015 elections that brought Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy to power were conducted within the framework of the 2008 constitution that the military wrote. Before handing over power, the military-dominated legislature passed a flurry of legislation that included promises of amnesty to military generals who have been accused of human rights abuses, a generous pension plan for departing lawmakers, lucrative business contracts slated to benefit outgoing generals and other elites and the transfer of manufacturing plants from the ministry of industry to the ministry of defense. And, critically, the constitution awards the military 25 percent of seats in parliament ó precisely the figure needed to block constitutional reform. Its position remains so powerful that many observers wonder whether Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and the N.L.D., despite winning the 2015 elections in a landslide, are now held hostage by the militaryís brutal purging of Myanmarís Rohingya population. A critical consequence of the trend that new democracies tend to have their social contracts written by outgoing dictators is that while these democracies may be formed of the people, they do not function by or for the people. Citizens may be free from some of the worst abuses of authoritarianism, such as blanket censorship and outright repression, but they are not important players in determining public policy. In this way, democracy is a sort of purgatory in which they wander ó sometimes for decades ó with little capacity to determine its direction. This is a recipe for discontent with democracy. Major crises like a severe economic recession can provide the tinder for citizen disaffection to crystallize into rage and inciting voters to throw out traditional political parties en masse. This discontent can ultimately lead to democratic demise, as inexperienced new political actors appeal to demagogy and dismantle longstanding institutions without building a more solidly democratic foundation. Consider Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has used bluster and constitutional reform to gut the checks and balances and military vetoes that previously hemmed in civilian politicians. The 1982 authoritarian constitution that guided Turkeyís 1983 transition to democracy created a constitutional court with the ability to ban political parties like Communists and overtly religious parties. The military maintained autonomy over its budget and decision-making. Perhaps most egregiously, the top military brass and their collaborators made sure there was a series of clauses and articles that granted them immunity from prosecution for any crimes during the authoritarian era. A result was that the military and their allies continued to enjoy economic privileges, like retaining ownership of key industries, while avoiding prosecution for human rights abuses. In 1987, however, a major amendment to Turkeyís 1983 constitution lifted a ban on some outlawed opposition parties. This paved the way for the later rise of new parties like the Justice and Development Party, which, since the early 2000s, in the wake of a major economic crisis, has dominated Turkish politics. Indeed, under the J.D.P. banner, Mr. Erdogan was able to exploit the militaryís reputation for impunity, as well as dissatisfaction by clerics and conservative citizens in the Anatolian heartland with the ironclad separation of church and state imposed by the constitution and enforced by the military. His populist economic policies have been wedded to a protracted campaign to consolidate the power of the executive branch, weaken the military (including jailing officers), empower Islamists, enervate individual liberties and the judiciary, and ultimately replace Turkeyís holdover constitution with his own. He achieved that much in 2017 after a popular referendum approved 18 amendments to the constitution, which transformed Turkey into a presidential system in which the executive exercises outsize power, including the ability to appoint the majority of judges and prosecutors. Democratic erosion has followed a similar pattern in other countries as well. Hungaryís ever more authoritarian prime minister, Victor Orban, leveraged popular discontent with the countryís Communist-written constitution to renovate Hungarian political institutions with a new constitution in 2011. Mr. Orbanís reforms have hobbled the judiciary and cleared the way for his political party, Fidesz, to trample its opponents. Fortunately, elite-biased democracies can successfully reform their social contracts over time to become more egalitarian and representative of average citizens rather than sliding back into dictatorship. It is not easy or common. But if it is to be done, it tends to occur in the wake of these very same major crises or economic shocks. Mass citizen mobilization, when married to the material support of a faction of disaffected or disadvantaged elites, can succeed in amending or entirely rewriting democratic constitutions to eliminate the worst distortions to representation. But this requires patience, magnanimous leadership and citizen faith in the promise of what democracy can deliver ó all of which seem to be running increasingly short."

Last weekendís ìSaturday Night Live,î hosted by the actor and musician Donald Glover, turned Mr. Westís weeklong trolling into the horror film it felt like. But ending the week laughing at Mr. Gloverís sendup of Mr. West hasnít made watching him unravel any less infuriating or heartbreaking. Mr. West thought his recent return to Twitter after an almost yearlong hiatus, with relentless contrarian, stream-of consciousness tweets from the minuscule Negro corner of the alt-right world, would read like a takeover of Twitter. But thatís not how the platform works. Black Twitter runs Twitter, and Black Twitter swiftly handed Mr. West his lunch. Mr. West was reading the blowback and did exactly what a person does when he or she is losing ó he dug in. Black Twitter had seen that show before when Mr. West posed for cameras in the lobby of Trump Tower in December 2016 after being hospitalized. The anger at the rapper was because he has allowed himself to be a useful idiot for a useful idiot. Like Mr. Trump, who also brags about not reading books, Mr. West is parroting the racist right-wing talking points he has learned from watching YouTube videos. The same white power wing nuts who trolled him for years as a way of defending Taylor Swiftís honor are now over the moon to hear the rapper blame President Barack Obama for not ameliorating gang violence in Chicago, to see Mr. West at the office of the gossip website TMZ blaming his own enslaved ancestors for their enslavement. Because the trolls won the election, their dangerous drivel sometimes becomes policy, as the musician John Legend tried to tell Mr. West in a series of reasonable texts that Mr. West immediately published. Those talking points from Alex Jones and company perpetuate mass criminalization and incarceration, deportation and worse. When a poll shows 20 percent of Trump supporters would have opposed the freeing of slaves, itís more than a fun punctuation ending the night on cable news. Those talking points run in tandem with textbooks used in Texas schools that describe slaves as ìworkersî and their journey to America as ìimmigration.î The denial of the sadism and brutality of slavery is perpetuated when thereís ìanother sideî arguing to keep statues and symbols of the Confederacy in public places, and when plantation tours explain the generosity with which slave owners cared for their chattel. When Mr. Legend and Mr. West later demonstrated their lasting friendship by publishing pictures of themselves at a baby shower ìdespite their differences,î they advanced the fiction that theirs are two equal but divergent viewpoints. They are not. There is the same old white supremacy that denies black humanity, and there are people who struggle mightily against white supremacy and for black life. It would be unfair to call Mr. Westís public outbursts mere stunts. He was right about the MTV Video Music Awards best female video of 2009. BeyoncÈ should have won. Mr. West was at his most profound in 2005 when he said George Bush doesnít care about black people after that president did a flyby of the poor and black victims of New Orleansís levee failure. When Hurricane Katrina happened, Mr. West was a new artist and his ìCollege Dropoutî was an album that helped give millennials a clear sense of identity. He wrote about being insecure, about not being comfortable managing his new money and visibility. That honesty was refreshing. His self-reflection and self-diagnosis felt familiar to a generation that drafted dozens of confessionals a day on social media. Kids who were in high school and younger when Mr. West made his debut connected with him more than they did with M.C.s like Jay-Z or even Tupac Shakur or Biggie Smalls, who deserve respect but belonged to another era. 50 Cent seemed a Neanderthal compared with the nerdy, backpack-wearing Mr. West. Mr. West rose as the economy collapsed, and his open insecurity spoke to a generation whose struggle was the housing market collapse, not a crack epidemic. He is the son of a single mother, a professor who raised him abroad for a semester or two in China. His story was more like President Obamaís than 50 Centís. This new generation didnít necessarily believe in crowns, but Mr. West was their guy, and almost immediately after being chosen, he began to collapse from the pressure. Weíve seen Mr. West melt down before. His 2013 radio interview with the journalist Sway was as unhinged as Mr. Trumpís recent call-in to ìFox & Friends.î Mr. Trump and Mr. West both seemed to want the same thing in those tirades ó to be recognized as gods. Mr. Trump roared into the phone about the Breitbart calculator he uses to argue voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The rapper screamed at Sway, who seemed unwilling to concede that Mr. West is the greatest artist of his generation. Or maybe Mr. West was arguing he was the greatest artist of any generation. Itís hard to remember. We got a harmless new pop culture refrain from the interview ó ìHow, Sway?î ó and mostly moved on. But unlike Mr. Trumpís call, Mr. Westís interview with Sway was videotaped. We were witnessing something more than his outsize ego doing battle with his mammoth insecurity. His refusal to make eye contact with Sway was particularly off-putting. He spent the hour talking to the heavens ó not to the interviewer, not even to the audience. Absent was the wink and nod embedded in Muhammad Aliís news conference performances, where he talked about himself in the third person and invented the kind of braggadocio that would become hip-hopís bedrock. Watching Mr. West during that interview, some of us began to worry about his mental health. Like most of his fans, Iím not qualified or interested in actually attempting to diagnose an illness in Mr. West. He has shared with us that he has been medicated and hospitalized. He has also told us that his recent Twitter rant is unconnected to his mental health, that he is fine. His performance at TMZ was similar to his interview with Sway. It wasnít until Van Lathan, on the staff there, interrupted to take him on about slavery that Mr. West even seemed present in the room, and that was truly heartbreaking to watch. But what was dangerous was the way Mr. West included Candace Owens, an alt-right darling, a black woman and puppet, on his broadcast from the TMZ office. Her participation was most likely arranged by alt-right operatives. A Black Lives Matter strategist hypothesized as much on his Facebook page when he noticed white power operatives taking credit for connecting the two. With uncharacteristic generosity, Mr. West ceded the mic to Ms. Owens, who allows a racist, misogynist movement to hold her up as evidence that it is neither. Mr. Trumpís speechwriters made sure to include Mr. West in his recent speech to the National Rifle Association, thanking the rapper for ìdoublingî his approval numbers among black people. He was referring to a real poll, but he got it wrong. The doubling was only among black men, from 11 percent to 22 percent (with a margin of error of nine points). Mr. West barely owned the entire week. R. Kelly had some karma delivered to his front door, and the fascist, feeble Rudy Giuliani had his moments, embarrassing himself. But Mr. Westís shrill missives from the monochromatic sunken place that is his mansion may be consequential in ways he canít fathom."

At Berkshire Hathawayís annual meeting over the weekend, I relayed a question from a shareholder to Mr. Buffett about a comment Mr. Musk had made a couple days earlier. ìI think ëmoatsí are lame,î Mr. Musk had said during a Tesla earnings call. It was a criticism of economic principle Mr. Buffett that coined in 1999 and that has become something of a mantra for his faithful: Invest in businesses ìthat have wide, sustainable moats around them.î Such moats, Mr. Buffett has said, are made of the competitive advantages that benefit major brands and companies, like distribution networks, pricing power and brand reputation. But to Mr. Musk, they are a metaphor for being stuck in the past. ìIf your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long,î he said. ìWhat matters is the pace of innovation ó that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.î At a time when technology is upending even old-line industries that once seemed impenetrable to competition, might Mr. Musk be right? ìElon may turn things upside down in some areas,î Mr. Buffett said. ìI donít think heíd want to take us on in candy,î suggesting Berkshireís Seeís Candies division enjoyed an unassailably wide moat. The quip elicited laughter from the 20,000 shareholders who packed the CenturyLink Center. Mr. Musk answered the challenge immediately, saying he was starting a candy company. ìAnd itís going to be amazing,î he wrote on Twitter. Not only that, Mr. Musk said, he planned ìto build a moat and fill it with candyî ó making it impossible for Mr. Buffett to resist sinking his money into the venture. The repartee was good for some chuckles and clickbait headlines, but the mini-spat masked a more serious and significant debate taking place across corporate America: Have the traditional moats shrunk? When direct-to-consumer brands like Dollar Shave Club have been able to take on consumer giants like Procter & Gambleís Gillette ó so much so that Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion ó are any businesses still safe? Mr. Buffett owns Kraft Heinz, for example, but could upstart food companies one day overtake it, breaking through the substantial network of distribution and marketing arrangements ó and brand loyalty ó that Kraft Heinz has built up over decades? Mr. Buffett acknowledged that times had changed. ìThere have been more moats that have become susceptible to invasion than seemed to be the case earlier,î he said. To a large degree, Mr. Musk is a living embodiment of a gleeful invader. With Tesla, he is trying to prove that what was long thought of as a substantial moat around the automobile industry could be overcome. He has gone direct to consumer with Tesla vehicles, bypassing the traditional car dealers that were once considered a barrier to entering the automotive business. He even had what seemed like his own moat: a network of Supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors. (His initial panning of the ìmoatî idea followed a question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided.) But, in truth, Mr. Muskís experience ó and challenges ó at Tesla may demonstrate just how much a moat remains a powerful deterrent to competitors. In the case of the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed ó Tesla has already raised more than $12 billion. But even with huge amounts of money, Teslaís recent production struggles ó it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass-market Model 3 ó show the immense value of manufacturing experience. Mr. Muskís willingness to challenge convention has clearly pushed the automobile industry forward, but his progress has lately been bumpier than he initially expected. Thatís not to say he wonít succeed, but if he does, he may be the exception, not the rule. There are still huge swaths of our economy that have dauntingly wide moats, many of them protected by regulatory walls. Banks, which have been speculated about as ripe for disruption by financial technology companies, seem more likely to buy start-ups than compete against them. Airlines ó which Mr. Buffett once called ìa death trap for investorsî ó have consolidated, and enormous corporations control virtually all the landing slots at airports around the globe. Before it could get off the ground, any insurgent hoping to challenge them would have to find a spot to come down. Even many digital businesses have a moat: Google and Facebook control so much of the advertising market that it is hard to see how a kid in a garage with an idea could usurp them anytime soon. Amazon has itself has become so powerful that virtually every seller feels it has to go through it. And Mr. Buffett has convinced himself that Appleís deep relationship with its customers through its ecosystem of products and iCloud mean the business has a defensible moat. ìThere are some pretty good moats around,î Mr. Buffett said. ìBeing the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat,î he said, citing Geico, the low-cost insurance company Berkshire owns. Saturday night, after the Berkshire meeting ended, Mr. Musk was still tweeting: ìSaying you like ëmoatsí is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.î For better or worse, the limited competition that oligopolies face is usually good for investors ó even if consumers might disagree. But whether they have been dug by a companyís experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders. Perhaps Charlie Munger, Berkshireís vice chairman, put it best: ìElon says a conventional moat is quaint. And thatís true of a puddle of water.î"

The immediate question before New Yorkers is who takes over what has become one of the key law enforcement posts in the country. What canít happen is for lawmakers in Albany to concoct a back-room deal to install someone they think will further their political games rather than the cause of justice. Until voters have a chance to pick a new attorney general in the fall, the clear choice is Barbara Underwood, the stateís solicitor general, who becomes acting attorney general upon Mr. Schneidermanís formal resignation Tuesday afternoon. Ms. Underwood has a stellar reputation and extensive experience as a litigator, and would carry on the work of the office until the election. There are other questions ó about Mr. Schneiderman himself, about domestic violence and law enforcement, about power and gender in general ó for us all to consider. Mr. Schneidermanís fall was so fast, the allegations against him so appalling and the depth of his apparent hypocrisy so astounding that the lesson will take some time to sort out. But it is already clear that his betrayal operates on at least three levels. First and most important is the betrayal of the women who were romantically involved with Mr. Schneiderman and who told The New Yorker of the physical and emotional abuse he inflicted on them. Their descriptions ó of his choking, slapping, spitting, threatening their lives, insulting their bodies, mocking their professional ambitions and trying to control their appearance ó are horrendous. In a statement Monday night, Mr. Schneiderman flatly denied assaulting anyone or engaging in nonconsensual sex but said, ìI have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity.î The four women who have come forward so far evidently did not experience it that way. The next betrayal is of Mr. Schneidermanís office, of his position as New Yorkís top law enforcement official and of his obligation to uphold the rule of law. According to his accusers, Mr. Schneiderman appeared to enjoy exploiting his authority to threaten and terrify them into silence. One former girlfriend, Michelle Manning Barish, recalled that one time, after Mr. Schneiderman violently struck her, he accused her of scratching him and said, ìYou know, hitting an officer of the law is a felony.î Another time, she said, he pulled her across the street, and when she said jaywalking was against the law, he responded, ìI am the law.î Mr. Schneiderman might say comments like those were meant in jest, but the blood and bruises the women reported suggest otherwise. In this regard, Mr. Schneidermanís case may be the most egregious yet of the #MeToo era. As one of Mr. Schneidermanís accusers told The New Yorker, ìWhat do you do if your abuser is the top law enforcement official in the state?î Itís a good question, and one that is sadly too common. Domestic violence in law enforcement families occurs at two to four times the rate in American families generally, according to the National Center for Women and Policing. In many cases, officers who abuse are not punished, and are even protected by colleagues and supervisors. Itís not yet clear how many people knew of Mr. Schneidermanís alleged behavior, but these accusations come as such a shock in large part because of the values Mr. Schneiderman professed to hold. This irony is at the heart of his final betrayal. Mr. Schneiderman made womenís rights a centerpiece of his agenda, going back to his time as a New York state senator, when he introduced legislation that made life-threatening strangulation a violent felony. He praised the ìbrave women and men who spoke upî about the sexual harassment they suffered, and the ìcritical national reckoningî brought about by the exposure of Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men. His office had even begun an investigation of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., for his decision not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015 following a womanís accusation that he had groped her. In yet another layer of irony, Mr. Vance is now investigating the allegations against Mr. Schneiderman, whose Manhattan apartment was allegedly the site of many of the acts. Certainly an inquiry is warranted, although given the recent history between these two offices, it might be more appropriately handled by someone else. After the 2016 election, Mr. Schneiderman styled himself as an avatar of the resistance to President Trumpís agenda, bringing more than a hundred actions against the administration. As recently as last week, he was pushing to change New York law to allow for state prosecutions of Trump aides in case the president pardoned them for federal crimes. (Speaking of Mr. Trumpís supporters, they are the last people who should be gloating about the downfall of a sexual abuser.) In the coming weeks and months, many qualified people will consider running for attorney general. We look forward to a competitive primary that delivers the honest, independent, moral ó and perhaps for a change, female ó law enforcement leader New Yorkers need. As Mr. Schneiderman said just a few days ago, ìIf a woman cannot control her body, she is not truly equal.î The state deserves an attorney general who will live by those words."

What Happens Now?,The attorney general had made his name since 2016 a crusader against Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agenda and a counterweight to the presidential pardon powers.,"Shane Goldmacher, Alan Feuer",N.Y. / Region,US,"US Politics, Attorney general, Amnesties Commutations and Pardons, Eric T Schneiderman, Donald Trump","For the last 17 months, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, had held himself up as the anti-Trump: a one-man legal battering ram, taking on the president and his agenda in both the courts and the court of public opinion. His sudden and spectacular downfall ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Schneiderman announced his resignation hours after four women emerged to describe in detail how he had physically assaulted them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has raised questions of whether a powerful office at the heart of the Democratic legal resistance could be sidelined and besmirched by scandal. Some have even held up Mr. Schneiderman as a potential backstop to prosecute crimes should President Trump choose to pardon his associates in the ongoing special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III. The president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vast federal pardoning powers do not apply to violation of state laws. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you imagine a next attorney general in New York who is not as interested in being the big anti-Trump figure, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a potentially significant difference, ‚<U+0080>ù said Benjamin Wittes, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and the editor in chief of LawFare. Advertisement G. Oliver Koppell, who served as New York attorney general for one year in the 1990s, said much of the office‚<U+0080><U+0099>s direction ‚<U+0080><U+009C>depends on the personality‚<U+0080>ù of its leader. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eric was very aggressive in challenging the Trump agenda in all sorts of ways, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very difficult to predict what the next attorney general will pursue, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Koppell said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know if the next attorney general will be equally aggressive.‚<U+0080>ù [Who will be the next attorney general? Here are some of the leading contenders.] Mr. Trump sparred with Mr. Schneiderman long before he became president, including about a civil investigation into Trump University that resulted in a $25 million settlement. Mr. Schneiderman had also opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 2016 and then the Eric Trump Foundation in 2017. After Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resignation, allies of Mr. Trump cheered his demise. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Gotcha, ‚<U+0080>ù tweeted Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, digging up an old tweet from Mr. Schneiderman in which he had reminded the president that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no one is above the law.‚<U+0080>ù Donald Trump Jr., the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s son, tweeted about Mr. Schneiderman no less than 10 times late Monday and early Tuesday. Mr. Schneiderman had focused intensely on Mr. Trump since the day after the 2016 election, when he said he gathered staff in Manhattan to discuss reorienting their whole operation. Since then, Mr. Schneiderman had engaged in dozens of lawsuits and administrative actions to challenge Mr. Trump from the earliest days of the administration. So will Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abrupt exit leave a vacuum for Democrats, either politically or legally? ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The short answer is the work goes on, ‚<U+0080>ù said Sean Rankin, the executive director of the Democratic Attorneys General Association. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It does not slow down.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Even though Mr. Schneiderman has often served as the public face of the sprawling legal battles against Mr. Trump, Mr. Rankin said that his organization had already devised a strategy to share responsibility for the various lawsuits against the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policies. Doug Chin, the attorney general of Hawaii, for instance, took the lead against Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s travel ban, Mr. Rankin said, and Xavier Becerra, California‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attorney general, stepped to the front in fighting back against the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attempts to repeal President Barack Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s signature health care law. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>States are protecting their people, values and economy, and that will continue as leaders throughout the country continue to emerge to resist and persist, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Becerra said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nothing is going to change, ‚<U+0080>ù predicted James E.

In particular, Mr. Schneiderman had positioned his office as a fail-safe in the special counsel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s probe. In recent weeks, Mr. Schneiderman had sought to exempt New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s double-jeopardy law from cases that involved presidential pardons. But now he is the subject of a criminal investigation, begun Tuesday by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. The future of that inquiry remained in doubt after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he was considering appointing a special prosecutor to look into the charges. For the time being, the office of attorney general will be taken over by Barbara Underwood, who has served as New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s solicitor general for a decade, and who is respected in the legal community, though not seen as particularly political. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She is not someone who has had experience rushing up to a political podium to inveigh against the so-called forces of evil, ‚<U+0080>ù said Seth W. Waxman, who worked with Ms. Underwood when he served as solicitor general under President Bill Clinton. With Mr. Schneiderman out and Ms. Underwood in, some Democratic attorneys general from across the country discussed the new legal landscape on their regular weekly call on Tuesday. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The A.G.s and I spoke about her today, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rankin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s got a tremendous reputation. They‚<U+0080><U+0099>re looking forward to working with her.‚<U+0080>ù She could also be not long in the job: State legislators gathered in Albany on Tuesday, less than 12 hours after Mr. Schneiderman announced he would step down, to discuss whom they want to appoint to fill out his term. A long list of Democrats have already begun jockeying behind the scenes to either win appointment or run for one of the plum jobs in New York politics. The primaries will be held in September. Mr. Wittes, the Brookings Institution fellow, said playing the role of anti-Trump would likely appeal to any Democrat who becomes attorney general. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Using that position as a launching pad for higher political ambition by opposing Trump is going to be an irresistible opportunity for some Democratic lawyer, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. For Mr. Trump, the resignation represented a welcome end to an elected official he donated to in 2010 but turned against as Mr. Schneiderman began to investigate his business practices, calling him ‚<U+0080><U+009C>incompetent, ‚<U+0080>ù a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hack‚<U+0080>ù and a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>shakedown artist.‚<U+0080>ù In 2013, he compared Mr. Schneiderman unfavorably to two other Democratic politicians felled by scandal: former Representative Anthony Weiner and former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weiner is gone, Spitzer is gone ‚<U+0080><U+0094> next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Trump wrote then. As a result of the insults, investigations and lawsuits, Mr. Schneiderman emerged as the most visible attorney general taking on Mr. Trump ‚<U+0080><U+0094> much to the delight of Democrats. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are a super hero, ‚<U+0080>ù the late-night comedian Samantha Bee told him on her show last fall. During the segment, she featured Mr. Schneiderman on a series of faux comic book covers battling Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agenda. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>With great power, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman quoted the famous Spiderman line back to her, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>comes great responsibility.‚<U+0080>ù"

Now itís up to legislators to pick a true champion.,The Editorial Board,Opinion,US,"Rape, US Politics, State legislature, MeToo Movement, Democrats, Eric T Schneiderman, New York","Until Monday evening New Yorkís Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was a public champion of the #MeToo movement. Now he appears to be the latest sickening example of the scale and insidiousness of the cruelty that movement is confronting. He resigned late Monday after The New Yorker magazine published an article in which four women accused him of abusing them physically and emotionally. Gov. Andrew Cuomo should appoint a responsible, independent prosecutor to investigate any possible criminal charges against Mr. Schneiderman and abuses of his office. Mr. Schneiderman admitted no wrongdoing. Instead, he said in a statement that the ìserious allegations, which I strongly contest,î had made it impossible to do his job. But the allegations outlined by the women are consistent, detailed and bone-chilling. Two women who had been in relationships with Mr. Schneiderman ó Michelle Manning Barish, a liberal activist, and Tanya Selvaratnam, an author ó told the magazine that he choked and hit them, often during sex, and subjected them to verbal abuse. They said he slapped them so hard that Ms. Manning Barish bled from her ear long after the blow, while Ms. Selvaratnam suffered from episodes of vertigo. Both said Mr. Schneiderman threatened to kill them, while Ms. Selvaratnam said the state attorney also warned her he could have her followed and her phone tapped. The women told The New Yorker that Mr. Schneiderman drank heavily, and would often force them to drink alcohol. Ms. Selvaratnam told the magazine Mr. Schneiderman called her his ìbrown slave,î and forced her to say that she was, ìhis property.î Mr. Schneiderman joins a sorry list of once-rising stars in New Yorkís Democratic Party whose careers imploded amid allegations of personal misconduct, including former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and former Congressman Anthony Weiner. As was the case with those men, the resignation of Mr. Schneiderman could have far-reaching consequences. The attorney general was in the midst of pushing a proposal to change New Yorkís double jeopardy statute so any aides to President Trump that he might pardon ó in an effort to keep them from cooperating with the special counsel ó could be prosecuted under state charges. Mr. Schneidermanís moralizing may have proven hollow, but that proposal remains worthy given Mr. Trumpís continual attempts to derail the special counselís investigation, including raising the prospect of such pardons. Mr. Schneidermanís office this year also brought a civil rights lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer accused of sexual assault and other misconduct. Under state law, the Senate and Assembly will jointly choose Mr. Schneidermanís replacement, effectively giving the power to his fellow Democrats. Later, voters will go to the polls in the Democratic primary, and have their say about who would face the Republican candidate in November. Whoever serves in this important office should be tough and independent, willing to stand up to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cuomo and ó it should go without saying, but now it needs to be said ó be a decent human being. Anyone involved in the effort to replace Mr. Schneiderman should remember: No one is above the law."

Schneiderman, New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attorney general and a central figure in the liberal resistance to President Trump, after allegations that he had physically abused multiple women set off an immediate storm of speculation in New York about his potential successor, and raised questions nationwide about the fate of his legal challenges to the Trump administration. Even before Mr. Schneiderman announced his resignation late Monday evening, just hours after The New Yorker first published the accusations, New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political circles were already abuzz with talk of who would replace him. He had been the heavy favorite to win a third term in November. Until the election, the vacancy will be filled by the State Assembly and State Senate, which under New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Constitution make the choice by joint ballot. That effectively places the decision in the hands of the Assembly, which comprises an overwhelming majority of the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legislators and is dominated by Democrats ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The effective choice is with the Speaker, ‚<U+0080>ù said Gerald Benjamin, a political science professor at SUNY-New Paltz, referring to Carl E. Heastie, the leader of the Assembly Democrats. Advertisement Names of potential successors proliferated quickly and included Kathleen Rice, a United States representative from Long Island who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Schneiderman in the 2010 Democratic primary; Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney from Manhattan; Alphonso David, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief counsel; Michael Gianaris, a state senator from Queens and chief political strategist for the Democratic conference; Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham Law School professor who ran for governor in 2014; Helene Weinstein, who chairs the Assembly‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Ways and Means Committee; and Benjamin Lawsky, formerly the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top financial regulator. None have publicly expressed interest, and it is unclear whether they would also seek to run in the general election in November. The Assembly Democrats were scheduled to meet on Tuesday morning to discuss the choice. New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s solicitor general, Barbara D. Underwood, will lead the office in the meantime, according to Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the attorney general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office. Ms. Underwood, a graduate of Harvard and Georgetown, has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court and served as a clerk for former Justice Thurgood Marshall. According to The New Yorker, Mr. Schneiderman slapped, choked or spat on at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, two of whom spoke on the record. The horrific accusations included alcohol-fueled rages, racist remarks, drug abuse and threats ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including to kill the women or use his power as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top law enforcement officer against them if they defied him. Politicians and pundits in both parties joined in swift and unsparing condemnation of Mr. Schneiderman. But the conversation quickly turned partisan, given Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s meteoric rise as a relentless and outspoken legal foe of Mr. Trump who had sued the federal administration more than 100 times over policies ranging from immigration to taxation. Prominent Republicans nationwide reveled in the news. Donald Trump Jr. mockingly shared several old tweets from the attorney general, in which he had denounced the president and expressed solidarity with victims of sexual assault; ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t age well, ‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. Kellyanne Conway, the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s counselor, wrote in a tweet that Mr. Schneiderman had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>drunk with power.‚<U+0080>ù By early Tuesday, the president had not commented on Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resignation.

Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fellow Democrats had also called on him to step aside, with Mr. Cuomo, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Mr. Heastie saying the attorney general was incapable of continuing in his office. And people in both parties were quick to point out that some right-wing pundits who blasted the attorney general were also staunch defenders of President Trump, who has himself been accused of a slew of sexual abuse. While Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resignation signals the probable end of a career that many had seen as gaining quick national prominence, the legal fallout is most likely only beginning. Advertisement A spokesman for Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office had opened an investigation into the allegations in the New Yorker article. Mr. Schneiderman had, at the direction of Mr. Cuomo, himself been probing Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office over questions about its handling of groping allegations against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein in 2015. A spokeswoman for the attorney general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office did not immediately comment on whether that review would continue. Separately, Mr. Cuomo also said on Monday that he would direct an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>appropriate New York district attorney‚<U+0080>ù to investigate the allegations. An administration official said Monday that the governor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office wanted to avoid any conflict of interest and ensure the proper jurisdiction, given the attorney general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s review of Mr. Vance and the fact that some of the alleged abuse occurred on Long Island. Mr. Schneiderman had been in contact with a criminal defense lawyer late Monday afternoon to advise him on his response to The New Yorker, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Later, an associate of Mr. Schneiderman was looking for a lawyer to represent him in connection with the criminal investigation, several other people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Schneiderman has denied wrongdoing, describing the acts as part of consensual relationships. Several women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s groups that had previously supported Mr. Schneiderman ‚<U+0080><U+0094> he was known for being an outspoken advocate for women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advancement, especially reproductive rights ‚<U+0080><U+0094> expressed shock and sorrow. The National Institute for Reproductive Health, which had honored the attorney general at a May 1 luncheon, said in a statement that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>appalled and horrified.‚<U+0080>ù (By Tuesday, the group had removed Mr. Schneiderman from its list of honorees.) Sonia Ossorio, president of New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s arm of the National Organization for Women, which endorsed Mr. Schneiderman in his 2010 and 2014 campaigns, said she was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in shock.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m just beside myself right now, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. And political observers said the news would further erode public trust in Albany, which has been roiled repeatedly by corruption trials, sexual harassment scandals and other ethics controversies. Douglas Muzzio, a political science professor at Baruch College, said the allegations were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>another blow‚<U+0080>ù to our ‚<U+0080><U+009C>trust in government officials and in the institutions of government itself.‚<U+0080>ù Follow Vivian Wang on Twitter: @vwang3 William K.

Schneiderman was known as an advocate for women.",Austin Ramzy,N.Y. / Region,US,"Women's rights;Feminism, Eric T Schneiderman, MeToo Movement, Sexual harassment, Violence Against Women Act, New Yorker, Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, Domestic violence","Before his abrupt resignation Monday after four women accused him of physical assault, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York cultivated an image as an advocate for women. Here are some of his own recent comments about gender equality, abortion rights, and sexual harassment and assault. On the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act in 2014, Mr. Schneiderman said that despite legislation, threats to women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s physical safety remained a problem across the country. He said in a written statement: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Twenty years ago today, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Violence Against Women Act, a major milestone in our nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to prevent violence against women and help the victims of such reprehensible acts. But two decades later, despite the significant protections established under VAWA, recent events have shone necessary light on the fact that violence against women remains a prevalent and dangerous problem across our nation. Basic safety is not a privilege: It is a fundamental right. Protecting all Americans from harm, regardless of their relationship to their abuser or their gender, is and will remain one of the most important aspects of our ongoing pursuit of equal justice under law.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office published a brochure to inform victims of domestic violence of their rights under state and federal law. Advertisement In announcing an updated brochure in 2016, he said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve made tremendous progress protecting victims of domestic violence through enhanced legal protections and enforcement actions. Yet this month, we must recognize that our work keeping New Yorkers safe from domestic violence is far from over. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We know that domestic violence victims are often some of the most vulnerable residents of our state. Our hope is that our enforcement actions, as well as our education and outreach efforts, will assist domestic violence victims to escape the violence they face at the hands of their abusers and assist them in building safe, productive lives.‚<U+0080>ù On May 1, Mr. Schneiderman was honored by the National Institute for Reproductive Health at its annual Champions of Choice luncheon. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If a woman cannot control her body, she is not truly equal, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. He added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The federal government has been taken over by anti-choice and anti-women extremists. We need to reimagine the pro-choice movement and build a stronger, louder movement for women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s freedom and equality than we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever seen. Movement politics is not the politics of accommodation, it is the politics of perseverance.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman was a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act, and he saw his defense of President Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy to expand health care coverage as a protection of women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights. He told GQ magazine last year: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s important to keep in mind that in one respect the health care fight is part of a wider effort by radical conservatives to oppress and disempower women. Denying women access to contraception and abortion services is a critical part of the larger machinery of oppression, discrimination, and violence against women and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s incumbent on all of us to fight.‚<U+0080>ù After the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women, Mr. Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against Mr. Weinstein, his brother, Bob, and their studio. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have never seen anything as despicable as what we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen right here, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman said in announcing the civil rights suit. He said at a news conference: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our investigation uncovered a pervasive pattern of sexual harassment, intimidation, discrimination and abuse at the Weinstein Company. Women were coerced into facilitating Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misconduct. Sometimes they were targets themselves. If they refused they were threatened with insults. Their careers were threatened. They were threatened with physical intimidation and violence.‚<U+0080>ù He added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The board and management knew all of this. They knew how pervasive it was, and not only did they fail to stop it, they enabled it and covered it up.‚<U+0080>ù Last month, after Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of the The New York Times and Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker were awarded the Pulitzer Prize in public service for their reporting on Harvey Weinstein, Mr. Schneiderman praised their work in a tweet. Without such reporting, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they endured at the hands of powerful men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> there would not be the critical national reckoning underway, ‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. Without the reporting of the @nytimes and the @newyorker‚<U+0080><U+0094>and the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they endured at the hands of powerful men‚<U+0080><U+0094>there would not be the critical national reckoning underway. A well-deserved honor: https://t.co/h4QMPzEU5c Mr. Farrow was one of the reporters on The New Yorker story Monday that first reported the four women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations of violence by Mr. Schneiderman."
82,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,5:45:04,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/fighting-street-gun-violence-as-if-it-were-a-contagion.html,Fighting Street Gun Violence as if It Were a Contagion,"A program that started in Chicago treats street gun violence as an epidemic, hiring past offenders to disrupt transmission.",Tina Rosenberg,Opinion,Health,"Gun Control, Crime,, Chicago, NYC","CHICAGO ó Gary Slutkin, an epidemiologist, has spent his life treating contagious diseases: cholera, tuberculosis, H.I.V. ó and for the last 23 years, violence. Yes, violence. A disease is a condition with identifiable symptoms that causes sickness or death. That describes violence. And we know it spreads itself. There is overwhelming evidence that hurt people hurt other people. Children who grow up in poverty and misery do not commit violence ó unless they experienced it. If they were chronically exposed to violence as a child, they are more than 31 times more likely than other people to behave violently themselves. Dr. Slutkinís work taught him that to control an epidemic, people must abandon practices that spread disease. Changing community norms is a far more effective method than simply giving people information. ìThe best predictor of condom use is whether people think their friends use condoms,î he said. Thatís why trusted community members with some training are so effective. ìOutsiders can guide and train and provide people with skills,î said Dr. Slutkin. ìBut all epidemics are always worked from the inside out.î In 1995, he began work on an idea that is now at the core of a program called Cure Violence, which is part of the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health. (The program used to be called CeaseFire, and still is in many places. Thatís confusing, as Ceasefire is also the name of a completely different violence-prevention program.) Cure Violence didnít invent the idea of street work to reduce crime; Chicago was using it in the 1940s, according to Andrew Papachristos, a prominent scholar of gun violence who now teaches at Northwestern. ìBut Cure Violence took it to another level,î Professor Papachristos said. ìIt professionalized street work and put it into public health.î Demeatreas Whatley is 46 and a part-time college student who ultimately wants to get a doctorate in public health. He also works for Cure Violence at one of its 10 Chicago sites ó a new storefront office in the Grand Crossing neighborhood on Chicagoís South Side, one of the cityís most violent places. When Mr. Whatley got out of prison in 2008, after serving 17 years for aggravated discharge of a firearm, one of the first things he did was to volunteer for Cure Violence. ìI wanted my block safe,î he said. The use of a gun to settle even petty disputes is not at all the norm in poor communities of color. It is the norm among a very small group of individuals ó mostly young, mostly men. For this group, people like Mr. Whatley are the most credible messengers. For nine years he worked as a ìviolence interrupter,î which meant detecting imminent violence, talking people out of shooting and mediating the kind of disputes that often lead to chains of retaliatory shootings. I asked Mr. Whatley to describe an intervention. ìSay thereís a fight,î he said. ìThe guy who loses goes to get a gun. Youíve got to calm him down and let him save face. I tell him: ëI lost plenty of fights. At the end of the day, youíre a stand-up guy because you fought. Itís the coward who goes to get the gun.íî Mr. Whatley said people forget about consequences in a heated moment, especially if friends are egging them on. So he reminds them. ìIf you shoot this guy, youíll be the prime suspect,î he would say. ìDo you want to lose at least eight years of your life because you lost a fight? Why donít you leave it to us?î And he and his colleagues would then find someone trusted by the other party, who could persuade the man to drop the beef and stay away. A few months ago, Mr. Whatley began supervising Cure Violenceís new site in Grand Crossing. His group has 11 violence interrupters and four outreach workers. The outreach workersí job is to get the clients help, from finding a slot in drug or alcohol rehab to helping a client pack up and move in the middle of the night. All 15 staff members are from the neighborhood. Many said they had been doing this work informally before they were hired. ìThereís a sense of urgency to right your wrongs,î said Jessie Davis, a violence interrupter. Shooting is a relatively easy behavior to change, Dr. Slutkin said. People addicted to smoking want to smoke. Risk-takers want to have risky sex. But generally speaking, tough street guys brandishing guns donít want to shoot. John Hardy, a former violence interrupter who is now a senior program manager, said that such people often seek out an interrupter so they can back away from a public threat without losing face. ìConsciously or unconsciously, they want someone to talk them down,î he said. Every Tuesday afternoon, the Grand Crossing staff meets to review the past week. In late April, Mr. Whatley sat at the front of the room with his laptop, on which he tracks the groupís work. The staff members, all wearing black Cure Violence hoodies or orange windbreakers, went over the weekís incidents of violence, discussed particularly hot corners or blocks and described mediations they had conducted. One interrupter said that a fight had erupted over a video posted on social media, a huge generator of beefs. The interrupter persuaded the postís originator to agree to take down the video, and got the person who felt disrespected to leave it at that. ìGood work,î Mr. Whatley told the group. ìWeíre going to close out April pretty strong.î The staff had conducted 18 mediations ó double the number in March. In the past month there was not a single gang-related homicide in the Cure Violence siteís territory, he announced. Shootings are an after-school and nighttime activity, so thatís when the staff members go out on the beat. They go in groups of five to seven people for safety. After the meeting, one group drove a few blocks and parked in the lot of a Foodtown grocery store. They stood on the sidewalk, up against a chain-link fence. The location was strategic, just down the block from two schools about to let children out for the day. The staff gave out postcards with messages seeking an end to violence. Four young men who are clients of the program wandered over, and the staff invited them to a monthly cookout the group was holding on the weekend. They traded stories about their children. An outreach worker told them about a job-training program at Chicagoís power company. A middle-aged man pulled into the parking lot and got out of his car. When he was young, he had been involved in violence. Now the man is a key source of intelligence for Cure Violence, said an outreach worker named Chrisse. ìHe helps us stay on top of things,î Chrisse said. ìHe gives me a heads-up if itís clear or there are guys lying in wait. Iíll get a text: ëNot a good day, Chrisse.íî Cure Violence is working in a dozen cities in Latin America, and several in Africa and the Middle East. Iraqis are using the model to defuse sectarian conflicts, and Moroccans to try to reduce violent extremism. When the program began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the city was the most violent on earth, with a murder rate 31 times the global average. Thatís no longer the case. In the first five Cure Violence zones, which had 89 shootings from January to May in 2014, there were only five in the same period of 2015, and several zones went more than a year without a single shooting. In the United States, many Cure Violence neighborhoods have similarly gone on long streaks without a shooting ó some a year or two. Other places donít manage a streak but do have remarkable drops in violence nevertheless. (There are also some mixed results: In Baltimore a decade ago, the program reduced violence over all, but in one neighborhood murders rose, because of an intense gang war.) Cure Violence operates in 21 United States cities, but it will always be most linked to its hometown, Chicago, which, sadly, in recent years has been Americaís murder capital. The cityís homicide rate has swung wildly: In 2003, homicides dropped by 25 percent. Between 2014 and 2016, they rose by 87 percent. And last year, they abruptly dropped again. Chicagoís spike a couple years ago can be attributed to several factors: a breakdown of police-community relations after the shooting of Laquan McDonald by a policeman in 2014, increased access to already highly accessible guns, and Illinoisís multiyear inability to pass a budget, which has resulted in deep cuts to social programs such as summer jobs, after-school programs and drug treatment. Those cuts have also affected Cure Violence: At times itís been in 15 Chicago neighborhoods, and at times virtually shut down. Chicagoís conservative police department hasnít protected the program. The department has never been truly comfortable with the public health idea, or with ceding influence to former criminals. (The program is good for interrupters ó ìit keeps us from relapsing,î said Mr. Whatley. But some do fall back into violence; about a dozen in the city have been charged with serious crimes in the past decade.) But thereís something curious about the ups and downs of Chicagoís homicide rate: Every turning point in the graph coincides with a change in Cure Violenceís scope. When it expanded, murder started to fall. When the program was cut, killings started to jump. None of that is scientific evidence, Professor Papachristos, the sociologist, pointed out in an interview. Seven years ago, he wrote a paper arguing (pdf, Page 1053) that the programís rapid spread had come despite a lack of rigorous evidence of success. But heís changed his mind, he said, citing several recent high-quality studies of Cure Violence, including research on New York City programs. They found that shootings declined much more in Cure Violence neighborhoods than in comparable areas without the program, as did social support for the use of guns to solve disputes. ìThe evaluations are positive but at times still mixed,î said Professor Papachristos. ìBut to think itís going to work with every gang and every neighborhood is Polyanna-ish. What needs to be done is: ëWhatís the combination that makes it work? What are the contexts in which it doesnít work?íî Some of the answers are obvious. Like any program, it doesnít work when it exists only as a skeleton. And efforts to copy Cure Violence have failed when organizers leave out key parts, such as the focus on the very highest-risk individuals. Violence interruption is the heart of the public health model. But itís not the only part. Next week, Iíll look at a new way street workers are trying to keep people alive."

He has been considered one of the greatest prospects in his generation from a young age, but since turning pro in 2015 he has achieved relatively little at the tour level. He drew some attention for five-set losses in the first round of the United States Open against John Isner in 2016 and Roger Federer in 2017, but coming into the 2018 season, Tiafoe had won only nine of his 38 career main-draw matches on the ATP Tour. Only one of those victories came against a top-30 opponent. Tiafoe has 15 wins already this season, including six against top-30 opponents. He reached his first tour quarterfinal at the New York Open in February, and won his first title in Delray Beach, Fla., one week later. The surge seemed unlikely after the first month of the season. After going winless in two tournaments in Australia, Tiafoe returned home to Maryland downtrodden. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You get a lot of things going in your head when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re young and you haven‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really experienced it, ‚<U+0080>ù said Tiafoe, who is ranked 56th, a career-high. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not like you can just turn it on.‚<U+0080>ù Going back to his roots allowed Tiafoe to reorient his mind-set and his season. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went home and really recuperated, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Being back home is a great thing for me, being with my family, being with friends, being with people that have got your back no matter what.

Tiafoe decided to take part of his support system with him on the road full-time, adding his friend Zack Evenden, a 26-year-old Briton who played collegiate tennis at Florida A&M, to his traveling team to complement the work of his primary coach, Robby Ginepri. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the best thing I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve done, the best decision I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve made, having him here, ‚<U+0080>ù Tiafoe said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He keeps it real with me. He keeps the tour fun for me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At first we were just friends, but now he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s definitely taken on a coaching role under Robby. Robby comes to the bigger events, but Zack‚<U+0080><U+0099>s there each and every day. I credit all my success to him.‚<U+0080>ù That stability has helped ground Tiafoe, who admits he has ‚<U+0080><U+009C>had a lot of things going on‚<U+0080>ù previously, including changing agencies twice in his young career. Evenden said that a key for Tiafoe had been learning to take ‚<U+0080><U+009C>ownership‚<U+0080>ù of his tennis and measure his own gifts. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s understanding that he doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have to play his best tennis, highlight-reel tennis, in every match just to get wins, ‚<U+0080>ù Evenden said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s starting to get comfortable on the tour and realized that he doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have to have the match of his life just to get a win.‚<U+0080>ù Tiafoe‚<U+0080><U+0099>s comfort level on the tour shows itself in other ways. As he returned to the clubhouse after the final Sunday, Tiafoe turned up the stereo in a tournament car and gave a brief impromptu performance of OutKast‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Way You Move‚<U+0080>ù to an audience of charmed volunteers. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s good to bring a different feel to tennis, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what I feel like I bring, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I bring a different feel, a different swagger to tennis. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m very easygoing, and very nonchalant, it looks like, when I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m out there ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got a little strut, and I like that. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no reason trying to fit in: Just be you, ‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That was the biggest thing for me, just being me, and finding what works for me.

The police in Berlin are now appealing for information about the mother of Emma, Lilo and Hanna, who were all abandoned just hours after they were born around the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pankow neighborhood.

But the way the umbilical cords were cut indicated that the births had not taken place in a hospital. The babies were probably delivered without medical help, according to police experts.

Artificial intelligence systems, made by companies ranging in size from Google to the Chinese start-up Malong Technologies, rely heavily on a computer chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. The chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like Ethereum, a Bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin. With people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips, G.P.U.s have been in short supply over the past several months. Prices have increased by as much as 50 percent, according to some resellers and customers. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The chips are simply going out of stock, ‚<U+0080>ù said Matt Scott, a technologist from the United States who founded Malong after leaving Microsoft‚<U+0080><U+0099>s research lab in Beijing in 2014. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the problem is getting worse.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Malong, which is based in Shenzhen, China, is building a system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects. Doing so requires an enormous number of photos, and analyzing all these photos depends on the G.P.U. chip. When the company recently ordered new hardware from a supplier in China, the shipment was delayed by four weeks. And the price of the chips was about 15 percent higher than it had been six months earlier. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We need the latest G.P.U.s to stay competitive, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Scott said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a tangible impact to our research work.‚<U+0080>ù But he did not blame the shortage on other A.I. specialists. He blamed it on cryptocurrency miners. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have never had this problem before, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was only when crypto got hot that we saw a significant slowdown in our ability to get G.P.U.s.‚<U+0080>ù G.P.U.s were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software. In recent years, they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence. Almost every A.I. company relies on the chips. Like Malong, those companies build what are called neural networks, complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Large numbers of G.P.U.s, which consume relatively little electrical power and can be packed into a small space, can process the huge amounts of math required by neural networks more efficiently than standard chips. Speculators in digital currency are snapping up G.P.U.s for a very different purpose. After setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives, people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins. G.P.U.s are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining. Crypto miners bought 3 million G.P.U. boards ‚<U+0080><U+0094> flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> worth $776 million last year, said Joe Peddie, a researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades. Advertisement That may not sound like a lot in an overall market worth more than $15 billion, but the combination of A.I. builders and crypto miners ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not to mention gamers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has squeezed the G.P.U. supply. Things have gotten so tight that resellers for Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker that produces 70 percent of the G. P.U. boards, often restrict how many a company can buy each day. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is a tough moment. We could do more if we had more of these‚<U+0080>ù chips in our data centers, said Kevin Scott, Microsoft‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief technology officer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are real products that could be getting better right now for real users. This is not a theoretical exercise.‚<U+0080>ù Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. AMD, another G.P.U. supplier, and other companies, say that some of current shortage is a result of a limited worldwide supply of other components on G.P.U. boards, and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize. But in March, at his company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s annual chip conference in Silicon Valley, Nvidia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough. This has created an opportunity for numerous other chip makers. A company called Bitmain, for instance, has released a new chip specifically for mining Ethereum coins. Google has built its own chip for work on A.I. and is giving other companies access to it through a cloud computing service. Last month, Facebook indicated in a series of online job postings that it, too, was working to build a chip just for A.I. Dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized G.P.U. into smaller niches, and more companies producing chips means a greater supply and lower prices. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You want this not just for economic reasons, but for supply chain stability, ‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Scott of Microsoft. The market will not diversify overnight. Matthew Zeiler, the chief executive and founder of a computer-vision start-up in New York, said the prices of some of the G.P.U. boards that the company uses have risen more than 40 percent since last year. Mr. Zeiler believes that Nvidia will be very hard to unseat. Many companies will stick with the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s technology because that is what they are familiar with, and because the G.P.U. boards it provides can do more than one thing. Kevin Zhang, the founder of ABC Consulting, has bought thousands of G.P.U.s for mining various digital currencies. He said that a chip just for, say, mining Ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners. It cannot be used to mine other currencies, and the groups that run systems like Ethereum often change the underlying technology, which can make dedicated chips useless. Advertisement Interest in digital currency mining could cool, of course. But the A.I. and gaming markets will continue to grow. Mr. Zeiller said that his company had recently bought new G.P.U.s for its data center in New Jersey, but could not install them for more than a month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as a result of the same market pressures. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The demand, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is definitely crazy.‚<U+0080>ù Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz"

Eric Greitens of Missouri faces a criminal trial next week for a felony charge of invasion of privacy, he has sought to prevent the woman at the center of the case from testifying in open court. A judge in St. Louis denied the request on Monday, saying that he would not bar her testimony ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an account that could be crucial to prosecutors‚<U+0080><U+0099> contention that Mr. Greitens took an explicit photograph of the woman without her consent. Mr. Greitens‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legal and political fate could hinge on the account from the woman, who had sexual encounters with Mr. Greitens in 2015, before he was governor. So far, she has remained anonymous, though she has revealed details of her relationship with Mr. Greitens under oath to legislators in Missouri. Here is what we know about the woman, who is identified in court filings only by her initials, K.S. K.S. is a resident of the St. Louis area who works as a hairdresser. A mother of two, she was separated from her husband when she had her first sexual encounter with the governor. She is now divorced. Advertisement She first met Mr. Greitens in 2013 when he began visiting her salon and became a regular client. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought he was this perfect guy, ‚<U+0080>ù she told a legislative committee in March. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew that he was an author, I knew he was a motivational speaker, I knew he was a Navy SEAL.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Greitens, who is married, has been unambiguous about his relationship with K.S.: They had a brief affair before he was governor, and it came to an end. K.S. has described it as something more complicated. In her testimony to lawmakers in March, K.S. described her initial relationship with Mr. Greitens as friendly and flirty. In March 2015, it took a sexual turn when Mr. Greitens moved his hand ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all the way up‚<U+0080>ù between her legs during his hair appointment, she told the committee. They met at his home at his urging, an encounter that began strangely ‚<U+0080><U+0094> when she walked into his house, he searched her purse, patted her down and looked outside to make sure her arrival had not been noticed. In her account, she said they went to the basement, where Mr. Greitens took her photo while she was undressed and blindfolded, before threatening to make sure the photograph would be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>everywhere‚<U+0080>ù if she ever mentioned his name to anyone. She felt the only way she could leave his home was if she performed oral sex, she told the House investigative committee. The two had several more sexual encounters over a period of months. Then in October 2015, she told Mr. Greitens she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to see him or hear from him again, and he complied. He continued his Republican bid for governor, touting his background as a military veteran, family man and philanthropist. In November 2016, Mr. Greitens won the race by six percentage points, handing Republicans, who already dominated the State House and Senate, full control of Jefferson City, the state capital.

After the release of the legislative report detailing K.S.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account, some lawmakers said they saw her as a victim of abuse. Advertisement The governor has denied threatening K.S. and says that they had a completely consensual relationship. He and his wife, Sheena, have ‚<U+0080><U+009C>emerged stronger‚<U+0080>ù after the affair, the two said in a joint statement in January. When Missouri lawmakers released their report about the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s testimony, Mr. Greitens sharply dismissed it, saying it contained ‚<U+0080><U+009C>explosive, hurtful allegations of coercion, violence, and assault, ‚<U+0080>ù which he flatly denied. He said that the claims would be refuted by depositions and other evidence once he was able to have his case heard in court. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A court of law and a jury of my peers will let every person in Missouri know the truth and prove my innocence, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. For more than two years, the relationship remained out of public view. In December 2017, K.S.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ex-husband approached media outlets in St. Louis with a recording he had made ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in secret ‚<U+0080><U+0094> of a conversation he and K.S. had about Mr. Greitens. On the tape, K.S. tearfully admitted the affair and told her then-husband that Mr. Greitens had photographed and threatened to blackmail her. Since then, she has said that she was horrified by her ex-husband‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions and struggled to keep the story from being publicized. A reporter from a St. Louis television station booked a hair appointment at K.S.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s salon under a fake name, then used the appointment to ask her for an interview. K.S. cried and begged the reporter not to run the story. The broadcast ran on Jan. 10. Her lawyer released a statement asking for privacy, saying in part: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is very disappointing that her ex-husband betrayed her confidence by secretly, and without her knowledge, recording a private and deeply personal conversation and then subsequently released the recording to the media without her consent.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Greitens admitted that he had an extramarital affair, but denied any suggestion of blackmail. In court filings, she is identified by only her initials, K.S., a request granted by the judge in the case. She is considered a crime victim by the state. At the moment, she is expected to testify. She has been cooperating with the prosecutor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and is on the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s witness list. Mr. Greitens faces up to four years in prison if found guilty; the Missouri House could begin impeachment proceedings against him at any time, and lawmakers have called a special session for May 18, after the trial. Mr. Greitens also faces a separate criminal charge that will not be heard during the trial next week. He is charged with tampering with computer data in connection to an accusation that he misused the donor list for a charity he founded during his 2016 campaign for governor."

The two men met for coffee and talked of reconciliation.,Daniel Victor,U.S.,Domestic Politics,"Patrick J. Conroy, Paul D Ryan Jr, House of Representatives, Chaplain","Speaker Paul D. Ryan swore the Rev. Patrick J. Conroy back in as the chaplain of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, re-establishing the Roman Catholic priest in the post he had contentiously left just weeks earlier. Mr. Ryan had stirred a bipartisan tempest with his abrupt move to dismiss the chaplain last month, a decision Father Conroy publicly protested. Catholic lawmakers rallied behind the chaplain, who is a Jesuit priest, and last week Mr. Ryan agreed to reinstate Father Conroy after the chaplain rescinded his resignation, which he said had been forced. On Tuesday, Mr. Ryan suggested the two men were working to reconcile, telling reporters that ìFather Pat and I had a good cup of coffee this morning.î ìI think we can ultimately make improvements so that everyone has access to the pastoral services theyíre looking for,î he said. Father Conroy said that his coffee with the speaker was ìvery pleasantî and that they would be meeting for dinner next week. ìWe will be meeting again to talk about the deficiencies that were mentioned in his statements, and how they can be rectified,î Father Conroy said. He said he did not have more information on what those deficiencies were. Father Conroy said he was not initially given reasons for his dismissal. But in a letter retracting his resignation last week, Father Conroy said Mr. Ryanís chief of staff, Jonathan Burks, had told him something along the lines of, ìMaybe itís time that we had a chaplain that wasnít a Catholic.î He said Mr. Burks mentioned an interview the chaplain had given with The National Journal, and a prayer he had given on the House floor in November, when Congress was debating tax legislation. ìMay all members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our great nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great success, while others continue to struggle,î he prayed. ìMay their efforts these days guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.î Father Conroy said Mr. Ryan had responded to the prayer by saying, ìPadre, you just got to stay out of politics.î In a closed-door meeting with Republicans, Mr. Ryan had said that the decision was not based on politics or prayer, and that he had received complaints about Father Conroyís pastoral care, according to several lawmakers who attended. Father Conroy has served in the role since 2011, when he was nominated by Speaker John A. Boehner, a fellow Catholic."

Brody,Well,Health,"Sports, Sports injury, School Sports, Children, Parenting, Exercise;Fitness,, Soccer, Gymnastics","Few would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for childrenís physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time. When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and í50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun. But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of todayís parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons in March. Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their childrenís best interests, these experts say. Many parents encourage specialization in a given sport in which their children, often at very young ages, seem to show an interest or aptitude. Notions of college scholarships or professional glory often dance in the backs ó or fronts ó of parental minds, with some uprooting the entire family to give their kids a leg up. As Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, ìSadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their childrenís participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.î ìHealthy competition is becoming unhealthy,î the orthopedics organization maintains. ìMore and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.î The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports ìas engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.î Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries. Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Childrenís Hospital Boston and another of the conferenceís speakers, told me, ìIíve been doing Tommy John surgeryî ó an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players ó ìon more and more kidsî who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices. In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls. The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair. ìIntense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,î the orthopedic surgeonsí organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly. Dr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they canít play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured. But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said. ìChildren who specialize in one sport early in life were found to be the first to quit their sport and ended up having higher inactivity rates as an adult,î Dr. Popkin reported, based on findings of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine. He emphasized that ìparental influence on sports specialization can be profoundî and counterproductive if it doesnít mesh with the childís goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing. ìIf they lack an intrinsic drive, if theyíre not having fun, theyíll likely become frustrated and quit,î he said. ìWhen parents hire personal trainers and coaches, thereís an expectation of success that can create a pressure-cooker scenario and lead to burnout.î In a survey of 201 parents of young athletes, 57 percent hoped their children would play in college or professionally, Dr. Popkin reported. In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didnít begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens. ìYou want kids playing sports through life,î Dr. Popkin said. ìThere are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.î Itís also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that ìthey develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strengthî that can enhance their overall athletic ability. Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey. Itís a myth, Dr. Popkin said, that athletes who got college athletic scholarships or became professionals in most sports began specializing at early ages. ìEarly sports specialization is uncommon among N.C.A.A. Division 1 athletes for most team sports,î he reported. His suggestions to parents: ìExpose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if theyíre doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, theyíre overdoing it. ìA couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.î"

For many people that means a built-in best friend for life. But deep, lifetime connections like that can be ‚<U+0080>¶ messy at times, even in the strongest of bonds. Navigating those relationships is difficult in a different way than navigating your friendship with, say, your best friend from college. Ninety percent of people in Western families grow up in households with at least one biological, half, step or adoptive sibling, but for many of those people an agreeable relationship between siblings isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t always a given; it takes work. In a study of 6,630 Dutch adults, European researchers found that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past ‚<U+0080><U+0094> divorce, addiction issues, run-ins with the law or financial problems ‚<U+0080><U+0094> often had less supportive and more strained sibling ties. The quality of sibling relationships is one of the most important predictors of mental health in old age, according to The American Journal of Psychiatry. Research shows that people who are emotionally close to their siblings have higher life satisfaction and lower rates of depression later in life. In times of stress or trauma, siblings can provide essential emotional and monetary support. If your sibling relationships need a little rehab, or you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve long fallen out of touch, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s still hope. Advertisement The first step to establishing a healthy adult sibling relationship is to release baggage you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re carrying from childhood. A common source of resentment between siblings is a feeling that a parent favored one over the others. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s important in these situations not to be defensive, and to listen and appreciate a sibling‚<U+0080><U+0099>s perspective. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not true, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not the way it was‚<U+0080><U+0099> shuts it right down and keeps people locked in their place, ‚<U+0080>ù said Dr. Jonathan Caspi, a therapist and professor in Family Science and Human Development at Montclair State University. Having a discussion about each other‚<U+0080><U+0099>s experiences growing up is also an opportunity to acknowledge past sources of pain and heal them. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe as a child [you] really weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t able to protect them or say anything to be helpful, but now as an adult, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s another chance to go back to some of those moments and maybe correct some of the pain, ‚<U+0080>ù added Dr. Laurie Kramer, professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University. Like friendships and romantic relationships, sibling relationships require ongoing check-ins to make sure everyone‚<U+0080><U+0099>s needs are being met. An easy topic to bond over is where you want to go in life, both in terms of this specific relationship and your overall goals. Kiaundra Jackson, a licensed marriage and family therapist, suggests visualizing what kind of relationship you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to have with your sibling ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like having more frequent communication, for example ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and see if this is something you both want to work toward. Ms. Jackson acknowledges that no sibling relationship will ever be perfect, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but when both parties are working together toward the same goal, that allows for a healthy relationship that can be maintained and last throughout time, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Do you want to go back to school? If you want to have kids, get married, travel the world ‚<U+0080><U+0094> whatever it is you want to do ‚<U+0080><U+0094> share that with your sibling because they might want to go right along with you, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. When talking with your sibling, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t bring up anything that could create strife, like politics, religion or even rehashing traumatic childhood memories. Accept that some topics will be off-limits, Ms. Jackson said. While it can be tempting to bond over the latest scuttlebutt, gossiping about family members can be damaging to a healthy sibling relationship. If you have multiple siblings in a family, dishing dirt can create dyads and triangles, making people feel left out. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It can get really ugly, so avoiding that at all costs is really important, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Jackson said. Make it your policy to keep mum about harmful rumors from now on. While it might seem that siblings start from the same playing field, research shows that birth order affects children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s experiences. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>These comparisons people make as if they had it the same is really a lie, ‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Caspi said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have it the same.‚<U+0080>ù They have different experiences with different teachers and coaches and peers, all of which shape a person‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sense of self. Making comparisons between siblings will only go in a negative direction and will continue to foster jealousy between them. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s also wise to avoid comparing your, your spouse‚<U+0080><U+0099>s or your children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s achievements. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How much money you make, where you live, how many kids you have, whether or not you go on vacation all the time ‚<U+0080><U+0094> don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t compare that, ‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Caspi said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Just acknowledge everybody has their own individual, different accomplishments.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Just as you might regularly tell your spouse or partner you love them, siblings need those reassurances too. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Oftentimes with our families, we think, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Oh, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unspoken, we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t need to say it, obviously I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m going to be here for you no matter what, ‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù said Dr. Elizabeth Dorrance Hall, assistant professor of communication at Michigan State University and the director of the Family Communication and Relationships Lab. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But saying those things out loud actually is still really important.‚<U+0080>ù Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be afraid of calling more, texting more or organizing more get-togethers. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>On every single type of maintenance, people wanted more than they were getting, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So, you may think you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing enough to maintain that relationship, but likely, your sibling is wanting more.‚<U+0080>ù It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s simple to fall back on your shared history with a sibling, resting on the idea that you both must deeply know each other because you grew up together. But aging changes us into vastly different people, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s entirely possible your sibling might not even know who you truly have become as an adult. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Because of the family dynamic, how you were raised, who you were raised with, where you lived, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s so many outside factors that really determine how families function, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Jackson said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It really takes work on everybody‚<U+0080><U+0099>s part, all siblings involved to make sure that the relationship is maintained.‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Dorrance Hall suggests being mindful of carrying shared loads equally, such as taking turns planning family vacations, or putting in matching effort in planning dad‚<U+0080><U+0099>s retirement party, for example. However: Be realistic about how much you can expect from your sibling. Not everyone is going to be receptive to efforts made. If you discover your sibling isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t interested or capable of maintaining a friendship, tailor your efforts moving forward. That could mean being polite at the holidays, but looking for warmth and companionship elsewhere. Dr. Kramer recalled a study she conducted looking at intergenerational patterns of sibling relationship quality. For mothers who had a poor relationship with a sibling growing up, their offspring had a more positive relationship relative to the other families in the study. Advertisement The key that made all the difference? Being deliberate. The moms with poor sibling relationships were more diligent about correcting the dynamics they felt contributed to a poor relationship with their sibling. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They were really trying very hard to be intentional and do the things that they thought were going to lead their kids to have a better sibling relationship and it worked, ‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Kramer said. These moms didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t leave kids to their own devices to work out their conflicts. Instead, they carefully guided them to collaborate and solve the problem at hand. The moms who had a good sibling relationship growing up assumed effortless harmony would happen for their children and, as a result, it often didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. So no matter how close you are with your siblings, you have the power to make the relationship even stronger for the next generation."
90,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,5:00:17,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html,Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web,An alliance of heretics is making an end run around the mainstream conversation. Should we be listening?,"Bari Weiss, Damon Winter",Opinion,Domestic Politics,"Mike Cernovich, Maajid Nawaz, Jordan Peterson,,, Conservatism in the United States, Social Trends","Here are some things that you will hear when you sit down to dinner with the vanguard of the Intellectual Dark Web: There are fundamental biological differences between men and women. Free speech is under siege. Identity politics is a toxic ideology that is tearing American society apart. And weíre in a dangerous place if these ideas are considered ìdark.î I was meeting with Sam Harris, a neuroscientist; Eric Weinstein, a mathematician and managing director of Thiel Capital; the commentator and comedian Dave Rubin; and their spouses in a Los Angeles restaurant to talk about how they were turned into heretics. A decade ago, they argued, when Donald Trump was still hosting ìThe Apprentice,î none of these observations would have been considered taboo. Today, people like them who dare venture into this ìThere Be Dragonsî territory on the intellectual map have met with outrage and derision ó even, or perhaps especially, from people who pride themselves on openness. Itís a pattern that has become common in our new era of That Which Cannot Be Said. And it is the reason the Intellectual Dark Web, a term coined half-jokingly by Mr. Weinstein, came to exist. What is the I.D.W. and who is a member of it? Itís hard to explain, which is both its beauty and its danger. Most simply, it is a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities who are having a rolling conversation ó on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in sold-out auditoriums ó that sound unlike anything else happening, at least publicly, in the culture right now. Feeling largely locked out of legacy outlets, they are rapidly building their own mass media channels. The closest thing to a phone book for the I.D.W. is a sleek website that lists the dramatis personae of the network, including Mr. Harris; Mr. Weinstein and his brother and sister-in-law, the evolutionary biologists Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying; Jordan Peterson, the psychologist and best-selling author; the conservative commentators Ben Shapiro and Douglas Murray; Maajid Nawaz, the former Islamist turned anti-extremist activist; and the feminists Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Christina Hoff Sommers. But in typical dark web fashion, no one knows who put the website up. The core members have little in common politically. Bret and Eric Weinstein and Ms. Heying were Bernie Sanders supporters. Mr. Harris was an outspoken Hillary voter. Ben Shapiro is an anti-Trump conservative. But they all share three distinct qualities. First, they are willing to disagree ferociously, but talk civilly, about nearly every meaningful subject: religion, abortion, immigration, the nature of consciousness. Second, in an age in which popular feelings about the way things ought to be often override facts about the way things actually are, each is determined to resist parroting whatís politically convenient. And third, some have paid for this commitment by being purged from institutions that have become increasingly hostile to unorthodox thought ó and have found receptive audiences elsewhere. ìPeople are starved for controversial opinions,î said Joe Rogan, an MMA color commentator and comedian who hosts one of the most popular podcasts in the country. ìAnd they are starved for an actual conversation.î That hunger has translated into a booming and, in many cases, profitable market. Episodes of ìThe Joe Rogan Experience,î which have featured many members of the I.D.W., can draw nearly as big an audience as Rachel Maddow. A recent episode featuring Bret Weinstein and Ms. Heying talking about gender, hotness, beauty and #MeToo was viewed on YouTube over a million times, even though the conversation lasted for nearly three hours. Ben Shapiroís podcast, which airs five days a week, gets 15 million downloads a month. Sam Harris estimates that his ìWaking Upî podcast gets one million listeners an episode. Dave Rubinís YouTube show has more than 700,000 subscribers. Offline and in the real world, members of the I.D.W. are often found speaking to one another in packed venues around the globe. In July, for example, Jordan Peterson, Douglas Murray and Mr. Harris will appear together at the O2 Arena in London. But as the members of the Intellectual Dark Web become genuinely popular, they are also coming under more scrutiny. On April 21, Kanye West crystallized this problem when he tweeted seven words that set Twitter on fire: ìI love the way Candace Owens thinks.î Candace Owens, the communications director for Turning Point USA, is a sharp, young, black conservative ó a telegenic speaker with killer instincts who makes videos with titles like ìHow to Escape the Democrat Plantationî and ìThe Left Thinks Black People Are Stupid.î Mr. Westís praise for her was sandwiched inside a longer thread that referenced many of the markers of the Intellectual Dark Web, like the tyranny of thought policing and the importance of independent thinking. He was photographed watching a Jordan Peterson video. All of a sudden, it seemed, the I.D.W. had broken through to the culture-making class, and a few in the group flirted with embracing Ms. Owens as their own. Yet Ms. Owens is a passionate Trump supporter who has dismissed racism as a threat to black people while arguing, despite evidence to the contrary, that immigrants steal their jobs. She has also compared Jay-Z and BeyoncÈ to slaves for supporting the Democratic Party. Many others in the I.D.W. were made nervous by her sudden ascendance to the limelight, seeing Ms. Owens not as a sincere intellectual but as a provocateur in the mold of Milo Yiannopoulos. For the I.D.W. to succeed, they argue, it needs to eschew those interested in violating taboo for its own sake. ìIím really only interested in building this intellectual movement,î Eric Weinstein said. ìThe I.D.W. has bigger goals than anyoneís buzz or celebrity.î And yet, when Ms. Owens and Charlie Kirk, the executive director of Turning Point USA, met last week with Mr. West at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, just outside of the frame ó in fact, avoiding the photographers ó was Mr. Weinstein. He attended both that meeting and a one-on-one the next day for several hours at the mogulís request. Mr. Weinstein, who canít name two of Mr. Westís songs, said he found the Kardashian spouse ìkind and surprisingly humble despite his unpredictable public provocations.î He has also tweeted that heís interested to see what Ms. Owens says next. This episode was the clearest example yet of the challenge this group faces: In their eagerness to gain popular traction, are the members of the I.D.W. aligning themselves with people whose views and methods are poisonous? Could the intellectual wildness that made this alliance of heretics worth paying attention to become its undoing? There is no direct route into the Intellectual Dark Web. But the quickest path is to demonstrate that you arenít afraid to confront your own tribe. The metaphors for this experience vary: going through the phantom tollbooth; deviating from the narrative; falling into the rabbit hole. But almost everyone can point to a particular episode where they came in as one thing and emerged as something quite different. A year ago, Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying were respected tenured professors at Evergreen State College, where their Occupy Wall Street-sympathetic politics were well in tune with the schoolís progressive ethos. Today they have left their jobs, lost many of their friends and endangered their reputations. All this because they opposed a ìDay of Absence,î in which white students were asked to leave campus for the day. For questioning a day of racial segregation cloaked in progressivism, the pair was smeared as racist. Following threats, they left town for a time with their children and ultimately resigned their jobs. ìNobody else reacted. Thatís what shocked me,î Mr. Weinstein said. ìIt told me that a culture that told itself it was radically open-minded was actually a culture cowed by fear.î Sam Harris says his moment came in 2006, at a conference at the Salk Institute with Richard Dawkins, Neil deGrasse Tyson and other prominent scientists. Mr. Harris said something that he thought was obvious on its face: Not all cultures are equally conducive to human flourishing. Some are superior to others. ìUntil that time I had been criticizing religion, so the people who hated what I had to say were mostly on the right,î Mr. Harris said. ìThis was the first time I fully understood that I had an equivalent problem with the secular left.î After his talk, in which he disparaged the Taliban, a biologist who would go on to serve on President Barack Obamaís Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues approached him. ìI remember she said: ëThatís just your opinion. How can you say that forcing women to wear burqas is wrong?í But to me itís just obvious that forcing women to live their lives inside bags is wrong. I gave her another example: What if we found a culture that was ritually blinding every third child? And she actually said, ëIt would depend on why they were doing it.íî His jaw, he said, ìactually fell open.î ìThe moral confusion that operates under the banner of ëmulticulturalismí can blind even well-educated people to the problems of intolerance and cruelty in other communities,î Mr. Harris said. ìThis had never fully crystallized for me until that moment.î Before September 2016, Jordan Peterson was an obscure psychology professor at the University of Toronto. Then he spoke out against Canadaís Bill C-16, which proposed amending the countryís human-rights act to outlaw discrimination based on gender identity and expression. He resisted on the grounds that the bill risked curtailing free speech by compelling people to use alternative gender pronouns. He made YouTube videos about it. He went on news shows to protest it. He confronted protesters calling him a bigot. When the university asked him to stop talking about it, including sending two warning letters, he refused. While most people in the group faced down comrades on the political left, Ben Shapiro confronted the right. He left his job as editor at large of Breitbart News two years ago because he believed it had become, under Steve Bannonís leadership, ìTrumpís personal Pravda.î In short order, he became a primary target of the alt-right and, according to the Anti-Defamation League, the No. 1 target of anti-Semitic tweets during the presidential election. Other figures in the I.D.W., like Claire Lehmann, the founder and editor of the online magazine Quillette, and Debra Soh, who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience, self-deported from the academic track, sensing that the spectrum of acceptable perspectives and even areas of research was narrowing. Dr. Soh said that she started ìwaking upî in the last two years of her doctorate program. ìIt was clear that the environment was inhospitable to conducting research,î she said. ìIf you produce findings that the public doesnít like, you can lose your job.î When she wrote an op-ed in 2015 titled ìWhy Transgender Kids Should Wait to Transition,î citing research that found that a majority of gender dysphoric children outgrow their dysphoria, she said her colleagues warned her, ìEven if you stay in academia and express this view, tenure wonít protect you.î Nowadays Ms. Soh has a column for Playboy and picks up work as a freelance writer. But that hardly pays the bills. Sheís planning to start a podcast soon and, like many members of the I.D.W., has a Patreon account where ìpatronsî can support her work. These donations can add up. Mr. Rubin said his show makes at least $30,000 a month on Patreon. And Mr. Peterson says he pulls in some $80,000 in fan donations each month. Mr. Peterson has endured no small amount of online hatred and some real-life physical threats: In March, during a lecture at Queenís University in Ontario, a woman showed up with a garrote. But like many in the I.D.W., he also seems to relish the outrage he inspires. ìIíve figured out how to monetize social justice warriors,î Mr. Peterson said in January on Joe Roganís podcast. On his Twitter feed, he called the writer Pankaj Mishra, whoíd written an essay in The New York Review of Books attacking him, a ìsanctimonious prickî and said heíd happily slap him. And the upside to his notoriety is obvious: Mr. Peterson is now arguably the most famous public intellectual in Canada, and his book ì12 Rules for Lifeî is a best-seller. The exile of Bret Weinstein and Ms. Heying from Evergreen State brought them to the attention of a national audience that might have come for the controversy but has stayed for their fascinating insights about subjects including evolution and gender. ìOur friends still at Evergreen tell us that the protesters think they destroyed us,î Ms. Heying said. ìBut the truth is weíre now getting the chance to do something on a much larger scale than we could ever do in the classroom.î ìIíve been at this for 25 years now, having done all the MSM shows, including Oprah, Charlie Rose, ëThe Colbert Report,í Larry King ó you name it,î Michael Shermer, the publisher of Skeptic magazine, told me. ìThe last couple of years Iíve shifted to doing shows hosted by Joe Rogan, Dave Rubin, Sam Harris and others. The I.D.W. is as powerful a media as any Iíve encountered.î Mr. Shermer, a middle-aged science writer, now gets recognized on the street. On a recent bike ride in Santa Barbara, Calif., he passed a work crew and ìthe flag man stopped me and says: ëHey, youíre that skeptic guy, Shermer! I saw you on Dave Rubin and Joe Rogan!íî When he canít watch the shows on YouTube, he listens to them as podcasts on the job. On breaks, he told Mr. Shermer, he takes notes. ìIíve had to update Quilletteís servers three times now because itís caved under the weight of the traffic,î Ms. Lehmann said about the publication most associated with this movement. Yet there are pitfalls to this audience-supported model. One risk is what Eric Weinstein has called ìaudience capture.î Since stories about left-wing-outrage culture ó the fact that the University of California, Berkeley, had to spend $600,000 on security for Mr. Shapiroís speech there, say ó take off with their fans, members of the Intellectual Dark Web may have a hard time resisting the urge to deliver that type of story. This probably helps explain why some people in this group talk constantly about the regressive left but far less about the threat from the right. ìThere are a few people in this network who have gone without saying anything critical about Trump, a person who has assaulted truth more than anyone in human history,î Mr. Harris said. ìIf you care about the truth, that is quite strange.î Emphasis is one problem. Associating with genuinely bad people is another. Go a click in one direction and the group is enhanced by intellectuals with tony affiliations like Steven Pinker at Harvard. But go a click in another and youíll find alt-right figures like Stefan Molyneux and Milo Yiannopoulos and conspiracy theorists like Mike Cernovich (the #PizzaGate huckster) and Alex Jones (the Sandy Hook shooting denier). Itís hard to draw boundaries around an amorphous network, especially when each person in it has a different idea of who is beyond the pale. ìI donít know that we are in the position to police it,î Mr. Rubin said. ìIf this thing becomes something massive ó a political or social movement ó then maybe weíd need to have some statement of principles. For now, weíre just a crew of people trying to have the kind of important conversations that the mainstream wonít.î But is a statement of principles necessary to make a judgment call about people like Mr. Cernovich, Mr. Molyneux and Mr. Yiannopoulos? Mr. Rubin has hosted all three on his show. And he appeared on a typically unhinged episode of Mr. Jonesís radio show, ìInfowars.î Mr. Rogan regularly lets Abby Martin ó a former 9/11 Truther who is strangely sympathetic to the regimes in Syria and Venezuela ó rant on his podcast. He also encouraged Mr. Jones to spout off about the moon landing being fake during Mr. Jonesís nearly four-hour appearance on his show. When asked why he hosts people like Mr. Jones, Mr. Rogan has insisted that heís not an interviewer or a journalist. ìI talk to people. And I record it. Thatís it,î he has said. Mr. Rubin doesnít see this is a problem. ìThe fact is that Jones reaches millions of people,î he said. ìGoing on that show means I get to reach them, and I donít think anyone is a lost cause. Iíve gotten a slew of email from folks saying that they first heard me on Jones, but then watched a bunch of my interviews and changed some of their views.î The subject came up at that dinner in Los Angeles. Mr. Rubin, whose mentor is Larry King, insisted his job is just to let the person sitting across from him talk and let the audience decide. But with a figure like Mr. Cernovich, who can occasionally sound reasonable, how is a viewer supposed to know better? Of course, the whole notion of drawing lines to keep people out is exactly what inspired the Intellectual Dark Web folks in the first place. Theyíre committed to the belief that setting up no-go zones and no-go people is inherently corrupting to free thought. ìYou have to understand that the I.D.W. emerged as a response to a world where perfectly reasonable intellectuals were being regularly mislabeled by activists, institutions and mainstream journalists with every career-ending epithet from ëIslamophobeí to ëNazi,íî Eric Weinstein said. ìOnce I.D.W. folks saw that people like Ben Shapiro were generally smart, highly informed and often princely in difficult conversations, itís more understandable that occasionally a few frogs got kissed here and there as some I.D.W. members went in search of other maligned princes.î But people who pride themselves on pursuing the truth and telling it plainly should be capable of applying these labels when theyíre deserved. It seems to me that if you are willing to sit across from an Alex Jones or Mike Cernovich and take him seriously, thereís a high probability that youíre either cynical or stupid. If thereís a reason for shorting the I.D.W., itís the inability of certain members to see this as a fatal error. Whatís more, this frog-kissing plays perfectly into the hands of those who want to discredit the individuals in this network. In recent days, for example, Mr. Harris has been labeled by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a bridge to the alt-right: ìUnder the guise of scientific objectivity, Harris has presented deeply flawed data to perpetuate fear of Muslims and to argue that black people are genetically inferior to whites.î That isnít true. The group excoriated Mr. Harris, a fierce critic of the treatment of women and gays under radical Islam, for saying that ìsome percentage, however smallî of Muslim immigrants are radicalized. He has also estimated that some 20 percent of Muslims worldwide are Islamists or jihadis. But he has never said that this should make people fear all Muslims. He has defended the work of the social scientist Charles Murray, who argues that genetic differences may explain differences in average IQ across racial groups ó while insisting that this does not make one group inferior to another. But this kind of falsehood is much easier to spread when other figures in the I.D.W. are promiscuous about whom theyíll associate with. When Mr. West tweeted his praise for Ms. Owens, the responses of the people in the network reflected each personís attitude toward this problem. Dave Rubin took to Twitter to defend Ms. Owens and called Mr. Westís tweet a ìgame changer.î Jordan Peterson went on ìFox and Friendsî to discuss it. Bret Weinstein subtweeted his criticism of these choices: ìSmart, skeptical people are often surprisingly susceptible to being conned if a ruse is tailored to their prejudices.î His brother was convinced that Mr. West was playing an elaborate game of chess. Ms. Heying and Mr. Harris ignored the whole thing. Ben Shapiro mostly laughed it off. Mr. West is a self-obsessed rabble-rouser who brags about not reading books. But whether or not one approves of the superstarís newest intellectual bauble, it is hard to deny that he has consistently been three steps ahead of the zeitgeist. So when he tweets ìonly freethinkersî and ìItís no more barring people because they have different ideas,î he is picking up on a real phenomenon: that the boundaries of public discourse have become so proscribed as to make impossible frank discussions of anything remotely controversial. ìSo many of our institutions have been overtaken by schools of thought, which are inherently a dead end,î Bret Weinstein said. ìThe I.D.W. is the unschooling movement.î Am I a member of this movement? A few months ago, someone suggested on Twitter that I should join this club Iíd never heard of. I looked into it. Like many in this group, I am a classical liberal who has run afoul of the left, often for voicing my convictions and sometimes simply by accident. This has won me praise from libertarians and conservatives. And having been attacked by the left, I know I run the risk of focusing inordinately on its excesses ó and providing succor to some people whom I deeply oppose. I get the appeal of the I.D.W. I share the belief that our institutional gatekeepers need to crack the gates open much more. I donít, however, want to live in a culture where there are no gatekeepers at all. Given how influential this group is becoming, I canít be alone in hoping the I.D.W. finds a way to eschew the cranks, grifters and bigots and sticks to the truth-seeking. ìSome say the I.D.W. is dangerous,î Ms. Heying said. ìBut the only way you can construe a group of intellectuals talking to each other as dangerous is if you are scared of what they might discover.î"

The economy is in free fall. The currency is plummeting. Rising prices are squeezing city dwellers. A five-year drought is devastating the countryside. The pitched battle between political moderates and hard-liners is so perilous that there is even talk of a military takeover. Now, the lifeline offered by the 2015 nuclear deal, which was supposed to alleviate pressure on Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s economy and crack open the barriers to the West, is threatened, too: President Trump is expected to announce that he is withdrawing the United States from the agreement as soon as Tuesday, according to European diplomats. The chief loser will be the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, who will now look weakened, foolish and burned for the risk he took in dealing with the Americans. His opponents, hard-liners, will gain influence, analysts say. But in the long term, the unraveling of the nuclear agreement could be bad news for the entire Iranian leadership, already buffeted by mounting popular dissatisfaction over the economy and a lack of freedoms and prospects. It could be bad news for average Iranians, too. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will see more migration, more unemployment, more bankruptcies, more impoverishment, ‚<U+0080>ù said Amirhossein Hasani, who once made kitchen equipment but now tries to make a living selling foreign exchange. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Some might think this will lead to regime change, but protests will be cracked down and the government will be able to run the country. We will just get poorer.‚<U+0080>ù Even before Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision, the nuclear deal had not lived up to its promise of economic salvation for Iranians. Mr. Rouhani sold it as the solution to many of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s problems. He promised that foreign companies would flood Iran with investment and know-how, bringing jobs and opportunity to millions of unemployed people. He also said that the compromise would lift Iran out of its international isolation, something illustrated by several airlines restarting connections to Tehran after the deal had been struck. But deeper-rooted problems such as uncompetitive investment laws, widespread corruption and arrests of dual nationals by hard-line security forces dampened the boom the president had promised. Foreign businesses showed up in sizable numbers, but balked at the conditions that confronted them. But what really cut back the potential benefits of the agreement was American sanctions, which have continued to prevent any serious bank from working in Iran. They also prevent almost all normal financial transactions, depriving Iran of much-needed credit and foreign investments. The return of even broader sanctions in some form could put even more pressure on the economy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone, please change our fate, whoever, even Trump, ‚<U+0080>ù said Ali Shoja, a cleaner who said he can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t afford to support his three sons. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I used to be a driver, now I clean. What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s next? I cannot become a beggar.‚<U+0080>ù Hard-liners, who have long lost popular support but control security forces, the judiciary and state television, are set to declare victory, since they have always argued that the United States can never be trusted in any deal. They will use the opportunity to undermine Mr. Rouhani and to try to seize power. But Mr. Rouhani himself came in after eight years with a hard-liner, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at the helm. That both moderate and hard-line approaches have now failed has only deepened the sense of crisis. Advertisement Dissatisfaction over state policies is so widespread many wonder if the Islamic Republic and its current ideology are even sustainable, fueling talk of bringing in a military strongman to set things straight. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a big failure for Mr. Rouhani ‚<U+0080><U+0094> America has cheated on him by not keeping its promises, ‚<U+0080>ù said Jalal Jalalizadeh, a former member of Parliament. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But in the end we are all losers. Now it is clear that only direct and open talks with the United States can ever solve this.‚<U+0080>ù In fact, a collapse of the nuclear deal doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t leave Iran with many options. Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s every move will be scrutinized by the United States and Israel, perhaps sparking a military confrontation the country can hardly afford.

Rhodes and his family that continued well after the Obama administration left office.,"Michael D. Shear, Ronen Bergman",U.S.,Domestic Politics,"US Politics, US Foreign Policy, Black Cube","WASHINGTON ó For years, opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran have accused Benjamin J. Rhodes, a top national security aide to President Barack Obama, of scheming to sell the diplomatic agreement on false pretenses to the American people. Now, just as President Trump appears likely to announce his decision to withdraw from the deal, evidence has surfaced that the agreementís opponents engaged in a sophisticated effort to dig up dirt on Mr. Rhodes and his family that continued well after the Obama administration left office. A detailed report about Mr. Rhodes, compiled by Black Cube, a private investigations firm established by former intelligence analysts from the Israeli Defense Forces, contains pictures of his apartment in Washington, telephone numbers and email addresses of members of his family, as well as unsubstantiated allegations of personal and ethical transgressions. In a separate case in 2017, the same firm was hired to gather dirt on women accusing Harvey Weinstein, the movie mogul, of multiple instances of sexual misconduct. It is unclear who hired Black Cube to prepare the report on Mr. Rhodes and a similar report on Colin Kahl, the national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., which were obtained by The New York Times from a source with knowledge of their provenance. The Guardian, which first published the existence of the reports on Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Kahl, said aides to Mr. Trump hired the firm, but there is no evidence in the documents that indicate any connection to anyone in Mr. Trumpís administration. A spokesman for the company vehemently denied any connection to the president. ìBlack Cube has no relation whatsoever to the Trump administration, to Trump aides, to anyone close to the administration or to the Iran nuclear deal,î said Ido Minkowski, the companyís spokesman. ìAnyone who claims otherwise is misleading their readers and viewers.î One person with knowledge of the reports suggested that the company had been hired by a commercial client with an interest in opposing the nuclear deal. The reports appear to be aimed at undermining public support for the agreement by finding ways to discredit Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Kahl, who have been staunch advocates of the deal on social media and in television appearances. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Rhodes said he was surprised that ferocious criticism directed at him continued after he left government. ìI never imagined that upon leaving government, that not only would that information campaign continue, but that it would be supplemented by investigations into me and my family by shadowy international operations, involving foreign entities,î Mr. Rhodes said. The deal to curtail Iranís nuclear weapons program was signed by the United States, Iran and several European countries in 2015. Its critics, including Mr. Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, have said it does nothing to curtail the danger posed by Iran and will not curtail Iranís ability to develop nuclear weapons. The president said Monday that he will announce on Tuesday whether he will formally withdraw the United States from the deal, as he has repeatedly signaled he would. While there is no evidence directly linking Trump officials to the preparation of the reports, several current or former members of the Trump White House have repeatedly attacked Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Kahl for their support of the Iran agreement. Sebastian Gorka, a Trump supporter who served briefly in the White House as an adviser, has repeatedly attacked both men on social media and in conservative news outlets, accusing Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Kahl of working to undermine Mr. Trump and defend the Iran deal from its critics. Current and former Trump administration officials have also targeted John Kerry, the former secretary of state who negotiated the Iran deal for the United States. Even Mr. Trump himself said in a Twitter post on Monday that recent efforts by Mr. Kerry to save the deal amounted to ìpossibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy.î Unlike Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kahl and Mr. Rhodes were not part of the nuclear deal negotiating team for the United States. But even before he left the White House, Mr. Rhodes was the target of criticism for his efforts to help build support for its approval. ìWhy did whoever did this conjoin Ben and me? Why the two of us?î Mr. Kahl said. ìBeing vocal on Twitter would make me a target. But why would it bring down the Iran deal?î A New York Times Magazine profile of Mr. Rhodes in May 2016 described a White House ìwar roomî in which he tried to manage news coverage of the Iran nuclear negotiations. In the article, Mr. Rhodes was quoted as saying: ìWe created an echo chamber. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.î Critics of the Iran deal have seized on the article to insist that Mr. Rhodes ó and by extension, the entire Obama administration ó were secretly manipulating public opinion by misrepresenting the implications of the nuclear deal. The report on Mr. Rhodes by Black Cube notes that ìin the article, he boasts about the creation of an ëecho chamberí in which he told journalists what to say and they repeated it back over and over as original thoughts.î The reports also provide a list of several Washington journalists who have had ìextensive contactî with Mr. Rhodes. Among those listed under the heading ìcontacts to investigateî are Jeffrey Goldberg, now the editor of The Atlantic; Mark Landler, a White House correspondent for The Times who often writes about foreign policy; Andrea Mitchell, now NBC Newsís chief foreign affairs correspondent; and Glenn Thrush, a Times reporter who covered the Obama White House for Politico. On Monday, reporters asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, whether anyone at the White House had knowledge of whether aides to Mr. Trump had hired Black Cube to dig up dirt on former Obama officials. ìIím not aware of anything on that front,î Ms. Sanders said, adding that ìif something comes up, weíll let you guys know.î"

The American people are still waiting.,The Editorial Board,Opinion,Domestic Politics,"US Foreign Policy, Nuclear weapon, Embargoes Sanctions, DACA, Illegal Immigration, International trade, Border Wall, Border Fence, Kim Jong-un, Benjamin Netanyahu, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Iran, France, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, Mexico, UNFCCC, North Korea, China, Middle East","By reneging on the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has said for months now, he will be able to get an even better deal, one that would also control Iranís ballistic missiles and its regional influence. Sound familiar? It should. This is the same kind of gesture toward a better, smarter deal that Mr. Trump made when he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, the same sort of empty promise he made in saying he would supply plans for Middle East peace and better, cheaper, more accessible health care. So far, again and again, he has shown himself to be adept at destroying agreements ó a relatively easy task for a president ó and utterly lacking in the policy depth or strategic vision and patience to create new ones. When it comes to the danger of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, there is no sign Iran or any of the other major powers in the existing and so far successful pact will simply fall into line with Mr. Trumpís notional new plan. More likely, his decision, announced on Tuesday, will allow Iran to resume a robust nuclear program, sour relations with close European allies, erode Americaís credibility, lay conditions for a possible wider war in the Middle East and make it harder to reach a sound agreement with North Korea on its nuclear weapons program. In other words, par for the course. This man who, apparently because of one book and a reality television show, has a reputation as a deal maker despite a skein of bankruptcies and lawsuits, has been piling up quite a record of scuttled agreements that he suggests ìnever, ever should have been madeî and broken promises for a ìbetter deal.î Consider the Paris agreement, approved by President Barack Obama in 2016. Mr. Trump labeled it a ìcon jobî that is unfair to the United States, and in June he declared his intention to withdraw from it. Mr. Trump suggested he was open to renegotiating this voluntary agreement but has done nothing about it. Meanwhile his administration is chipping away at environmental protections through deregulation even as the nearly 200 countries who signed the deal remain committed to it. Or take DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also established by Mr. Obama. It provides temporary work permits and reprieves from deportation for about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Mr. Trump ended it but said he was open to fixing it. But he hasnít, ordering instead a crackdown by federal immigration agents that has torn countless families apart and left millions of other undocumented people in limbo. Similarly, the southern border wall, the centerpiece of his presidential campaign that was supposed to be paid for by Mexico, is more mirage than reality ó and whatever parts are being built are being paid for by America. He promised a better deal on health care, with cheaper costs and universal coverage. He never proposed one. Instead, after Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he attacked it administratively, increasing the number of people without insurance and raising premiums. One of his first moves in office was to withdraw from the United States-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he had called ìa rape of our country.î Last month he raised the possibility of rejoining it but then stepped back again. Then there is Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States, Mexico and Canada have been unable to agree on amending, after months of negotiations. As for China, which Mr. Trump promised to browbeat into offering trade concessions, recent negotiations ended with few signs of progress toward avoiding a trade war. The one agreement on which he forced new negotiations and seems to have scored modest success is the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Even so, the president has suggested he might delay finalizing the pact because it gives him a card to play, presumably with Seoul, while negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program. Mr. Trump often seems to be consumed with overturning the legacies of his predecessor, but few of the agreements so stoked his disdain as the Iran nuclear deal, Mr. Obamaís signature diplomatic achievement. Signed in 2015 by five major powers as well as the United States and Iran, it committed Iran to significantly curtailing its nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions. International inspectors along with American and Israeli intelligence and security officials have repeatedly judged that Iran is abiding by its obligations. That doesnít matter to Mr. Trump, allied with the anti-Iran hard-liners in his administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Ahead of his decision on Tuesday to no longer waive sanctions on foreign countries doing oil and gas business in Iran, cutting the heart out of the deal, Mr. Trump put the onus on France, Germany and Britain to address what he considered ìflawsî in the accord. For months the Europeans argued this could be done in a side agreement, while keeping the nuclear deal intact, but the effort ultimately collapsed because of Mr. Trumpís insistence on reopening the accord itself. Itís doubtful that Mr. Trump was ever serious about finding a compromise. The Europeans and Iranians still hope to manage the fallout, but Mr. Trump has no obvious plan B, except ratcheting up the pressure on Iran. It seems an oddly dissonant and counterproductive message as Mr. Trump has shifted from warmongering to diplomacy on North Korea and prepares to meet its leader, Kim Jong-un, to get him to abandon his nuclear program, with an arsenal of 20 to 60 weapons. Why should the North Koreans now believe the Americans, over the long haul, will honor a deal any president strikes? While the stakes with Iran are high, with North Korea they are even higher. Will that be another deal too far for Mr. Trump?"

Peter Pan helps sick children. Not fictionally; financially. The author J.M. Barrie, who was born on this day in 1860, donated the rights to his most famous creation to the Great Ormond Street children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hospital in London in 1929. In a front-page report at the time, The New York Times estimated their worth at ‚<U+0080><U+009C>roughly $10,000 a year, ‚<U+0080>ù which it said was equivalent to a sixth of the hospital‚<U+0080><U+0099>s income. It would have been clear that the gift was of lasting value: The boy who never grows up was introduced in 1902, becoming the subject of a hit play two years later, and then a novel. He had already inspired a statue in a London park, and even begun his long career in movies. But few would have guessed quite how long Peter Pan would pay. The copyright first expired in Britain at the end of 1987, 50 years after Barrie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s death. Within months, however, Parliament passed a measure granting Great Ormond Street a permanent right to royalties from the stage play and adaptations of it. Peter Pan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s adventures in America are also still helping the hospital; according to its website, the U.S. copyright does not expire until 2023.

Now, it is making Ireland an early test case for new policies meant to block such meddling in foreign elections. With a contentious May 25 referendum on Irelandís abortion ban approaching, Facebook said on Tuesday that it would block political advertising from groups based outside the country. The company also introduced a tool so users can see all the ads a group is posting on the social network, in a bid to increase transparency of political campaigning on its platform. Facebook has said similar tools will eventually be rolled out to other countries, with analysts and observers focused in particular on the 2018 midterm elections in the United States. The companyís response illustrates its more aggressive approach to regulating political advertising since the 2016 campaign, when the company disclosed that it had sold more than $100,000 worth of political ads to Russia-linked accounts. ìOur company approach is to build tools to increase transparency around political advertising so that people know who is paying for the ads they are seeing, and to ensure any organization running a political ad is located in that country,î Facebook said in a blog post outlining the Irish decision. The vote on whether to end Irelandís constitutional ban on abortion has drawn concerns that foreign groups will attempt to influence the debate through social media. Facebook said on Tuesday that groups working on both sides of the Irish referendum would be able to flag advertisements suspected of coming from foreign organizations. The advertisements will then be investigated by the social media platform. The company also said it would use artificial intelligence technology to spot potentially problematic material. Many countries, including the United States, prohibit foreign groups from advertising in domestic elections, but regulating the spending is difficult with more political activity moving online. Facebookís advertising system has become a favorite of political groups because it is largely automated, and makes it easy to target narrow segments of voters. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has made several policy changes to address concerns over the role it plays in elections and politics around the world. The company has changed its News Feed algorithm to de-emphasize political news, and has hired thousands of moderators globally to spot rumors and extremist content. The company is also changing its advertising policies, including allowing only authorized groups to buy political ads. In addition, it is planning to introduce a searchable database to show how much an advertiser is spending, as well as the demographic details of the audience a group is trying to reach. Another new election policy will include a verification process that requires an advertiser to be based in the country where the election is taking place. Europe has become a testing ground for some of Facebookís changes to protect against political interference. Before the German election in September, for example, the social media company deleted thousands of fake accounts and worked with election officials to more quickly stop the spread of misinformation."

Two months after inconclusive elections created a political stalemate, Mr. Mattarella asked his country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bickering political leaders to support a neutral caretaker government of his own choosing. It would last until they got their act together and formed a sustainable parliamentary majority or until new elections, as early as this summer but no later than early next year. Speaking at the Quirinal Palace on Monday night after a third, and apparently final, round of fruitless consultations with party leaders, the mild-mannered Mr. Mattarella seemed a bit vexed as he called the situation ‚<U+0080><U+009C>anomalous‚<U+0080>ù and admonished the politicians for their lack of progress. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It would be the first time in the history of the republic, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, that the Parliament elected by Italians was dissolved before it even went to work and selected a cabinet and prime minister. Advertisement Mr. Mattarella, 76, with fluffy white hair and discretion honed during his years as a Christian Democratic politician, is motivated most by a search for stability. A Sicilian, he entered politics after a Mafia gunman in 1980 shot and killed his brother, then the region‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, at point-blank range. Mr. Mattarella made clear that Italy, facing critical issues such as the euro and migrant policies in Europe, and needing to approve a budget and prevent automatic tax increases at home, could no longer wait while the right-wing League party, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement or others ironed out an agreement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The unwillingness of all of them was confirmed this morning, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that there wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any possibility to form a majority government.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mattarella, who usually has a ceremonial role but is imbued by the Italian Constitution with great power during moments of political chaos, said the government led until this point by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appreciated, but no longer viable. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s necessary to give life to a new government, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One can no longer wait.‚<U+0080>ù More than half of Italians gave their support to the League and the Five Star Movement on March 4, but neither won enough votes to win a majority in Parliament. Mr. Mattarella argued that the parties would have more time to work out their disagreements while a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>neutral‚<U+0080>ù government did the actual governing. Mr. Mattarella, a former member of Parliament, a defense and education minister and a judge on Italy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s constitutional court, became president in 2015 and since then has sought to stay above the political fray. In keeping with his trademark aversion to drama, Mr. Mattarella sought to avoid a return to the polls in the summer or fall, which could produce the same impasse. He said he hoped the parties could reach an agreement by the end of December, when his caretaker government would expire. If not, he said, elections should be held in the new year. Italy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leading politicians did not want to wait that long. The leaders of the Five Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, and the League, Matteo Salvini, met on Monday for the first time since the elections to pick a date for new elections. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>July 8 is the first possible date to vote, and Di Maio also agrees, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Salvini told reporters. On Monday morning, Mr. Salvini, whose party won the most votes in a center-right coalition with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, urged Mr. Mattarella to give his alliance a mandate to seek enough support in Parliament to form a government. But with the coalition about 50 seats short of a majority, Mr. Mattarella did not bother. Mr. Salvini then rejected the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s offer on Monday evening. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mattarella wants a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>neutral government‚<U+0080><U+0099>? Please, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Salvini, a gifted campaigner, wrote on Twitter, adding that Italy needed a government ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that defends in Europe the principle ITALIANS FIRST.‚<U+0080>ù Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Salvini seemed to anticipate the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision, taking to Facebook earlier to prepare his base for coming elections. He told them that more migrants were already coming and that if the negotiations failed, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we will come to ask you for that 2, 3, 4 percent more votes which would give us the chance to govern alone for five years, without asking permission of anyone.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mattarella had given the Five Star Movement time and space to find support on the right, with the League, and with the center-left Democratic Party that it spent much of the last few years insulting. But after 65 days of negotiations, he apparently had had enough. Early in the morning, the president met with Mr. Di Maio, 31, who, to reinforce his anti-establishment appeal, drove to the meeting in a small white Citro√´n. Speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Di Maio said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are not willing to support a confidence vote for a technical government.‚<U+0080>ù Arguing that he was not to blame for the stalemate, he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was never the impediment.‚<U+0080>ù Over months of talks, Mr. Di Maio, who is facing his party‚<U+0080><U+0099>s self-imposed term limits, failed to peel Mr. Salvini away from his center-right coalition partner, Mr. Berlusconi, with whom the Five Star Movement refuses to join forces. Late last month he slammed the door shut on any deal with the League. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Now I want to say it officially, ‚<U+0080>ù he said at the time. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me, any talks with the League end here. It is clear that a government with the center-right is no longer a pursuable hypothesis.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement But on Monday, with the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision only hours away, he scrambled to reopen the door to talks. In what he called a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>new phase‚<U+0080>ù of the talks, Mr. Di Maio said he was still willing to find an agreement with Mr. Salvini on a prime minister they could both support and who would push their priorities, including a universal basic income, anti-corruption laws and a rollback of pension reforms. After the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s remarks, Mr. Di Maio reiterated on Twitter that he would vote ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No confidence in a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>neutral‚<U+0080><U+0099> government.‚<U+0080>ù A failure of Mr. Mattarella‚<U+0080><U+0099>s temporary, technocratic government to win a confidence vote in Parliament would lead to new elections and, European leaders fear, upset the markets. Mr. Di Maio, a leader of a web-native and ideologically ambiguous party that has fed on the discontent of Italian voters, especially in the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poorer south, relished a vote that he characterized as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>run off‚<U+0080>ù between the Five Star Movement and the League. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clear that there are two political realities competing to lead the country, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the Italians will decide.‚<U+0080>ù Again.

Carroll,The Upshot,US,"Marijuana;Pot;Weed, Drug Abuse, Legislation, Smoking, Mental Health, Respiratory system","The benefits and harms of medical marijuana can be debated, but more states are legalizing pot, even for recreational use. A new evaluation of marijuanaís risks is overdue. Last year, the National Academies of Sciences, Medicine and Engineering released a comprehensive report on cannabis use. At almost 400 pages long, it reviewed both potential benefits and harms. Letís focus on the harms. The greatest concern with tobacco smoking is cancer, so itís reasonable to start there with pot smoking. A 2005 systematic review in the International Journal of Cancer pooled the results of six case-control studies. No association was found between smoking marijuana and lung cancer. Another 2015 systematic review pooled nine case-control studies and could find no link to head and neck cancers. Another meta-analysis of three case-control studies of testicular cancer found a statistically significant link between heavier pot smoking and one type of testicular cancer. But this evidence was judged to be ìlimitedî because of limitations in the research (all of which was from the 1990s). Thereís no evidence, or not enough to say, of a link between pot use and esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, non-Hodgkinís lymphoma, penile cancer or bladder cancer. Thereís also no evidence, or not enough to say, that pot has any effect on sperm or eggs that could increase the risk of cancer in any children of pot smokers. (Using marijuana while pregnant does pose other risks, as discussed below.) Another major risk with cigarettes, heart disease, isnít clearly seen with pot smoking. Only two studies quantified the risk between marijuana use and heart attacks. One found no relationship at all, and the other found that pot smoking may be a trigger for a heart attack in the hour after smoking. But this finding was based on nine patients, and may not be generalizable. It also makes sense to think about the risk of respiratory disease. In the short term after smoking pot, a 2007 systematic review found, lung function actually improved. But these benefits were completely overtaken by evidence that lung function may degrade with chronic use. Lung function, however, is a laboratory measure and not necessarily a clinical outcome, and what we really care about is lung disease. Once you control for tobacco use, the links between marijuana and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appear minimal. Almost no evidence is available to link pot use to asthma. Driving while impaired is a major cause of injury and death in the United States. Six systematic reviews were considered of fair or good quality by the national academies, and the most recent one pooled three of the others. It contained evidence from 21 studies in 13 countries representing almost 240,000 participants. For people who reported marijuana use, or had THC detected through testing, their odds of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increased by 20 to 30 percent, the study found. This is, of course, a relative increase, and shouldnít be confused with the overall percentage chance of getting in an accident, which is much smaller. Regardless, driving while impaired is a terrible idea. Although we have good tests to determine if people are under the influence of alcohol, no such tests are currently available for marijuana, making enforcement more difficult. Babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight, delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, according to a 2016 systematic review. But there were no links seen for changes in birth length, head circumference or congenital malformations. Thereís limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers, and thereís not enough evidence to comment on much else about babies and their outcomes. Thereís moderate evidence, from many studies, that learning, memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use. Thereís limited evidence, however, that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement, employment, income or social functioning, or that these effects linger after the pot has ìworn off.î The possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated. The most recent meta-analysis found that thereís a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis, specifically schizophrenia. This mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high-quality studies. Another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use and the development of bipolar disorder. Heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts. What makes this complicated is that itís hard to establish the arrow of causality. Are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems? Or are people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot? Thereís a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances. Some see marijuana as a ìgatewayî drug, leading to other substance use or abuse. Others see this as only a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well. As states legalize the drug for general use, more cannabis users feel freed from secrecy. They smoke more in public, raising worries about secondhand smoke. A two-year-old study made news recently by arguing that one minute of exposure to pot smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow for at least 90 minutes, a greater impairment than from tobacco. This was a study in rats, though, not of humans out in the world. As for risk of a ìcontact high,î the amount of THC detectable in secondhand smoke is negligible. Almost all agree that children should not use pot, but concerns are legitimately raised about whether children might have increased exposure or access after legalization. Although this issue has not been studied widely, itís possible that pot ó the THC and the metabolites from smoke ó could have an effect on the developing brains of children. These concerns are more applicable to adolescents who use pot regularly, however, not the accidental ingestion reported in the news once in a while. Almost all the harms the medical literature focuses on involve smoked cannabis. We know little to nothing about edibles and other means of administration. Nor do we have any consistent manner of measuring the level of exposure. Many of the harms weíve discussed are statistically significant, and yet they are of questionable significance. Almost all the increased risks are relative risks. The absolute, or overall, risks are often quite low. We havenít focused on the potential medical benefits here. But many people use pot ó even rationally ó for benefits they perceive to be greater than the harms weíve listed. We unquestionably need more research, and more evidence of harms may emerge. But itís important to note that the harms we know about now are practically nil compared with that of many other drugs, and that marijuanaís effects are clearly less harmful than those associated with tobacco or alcohol abuse. People who choose to use marijuana ó now that itís easier to do legally ó will need to weigh the pros and cons for themselves."

It was not one of his typical tirades against political foes. The tweet said the president was considering a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>full pardon‚<U+0080>ù for Jack Johnson, who in 1908 became the first African-American heavyweight boxing champion but whose legacy was tarnished by a racially-charged conviction four years later for transporting a woman across state lines for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>immoral purposes.‚<U+0080>ù The woman was his girlfriend and future wife, who was white. The tweet was a jolt to Haywood. She says Johnson is her great-great-uncle, and she has been waging a yearslong campaign to clear his name. Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon! ‚<U+0080><U+009C>From that point forward all kind of people were calling me, ‚<U+0080>ù said Haywood, who is not on Twitter. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was at that gas station from early afternoon until 6:30. I couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get off the phone.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement The president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweet cast renewed light on Johnson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story and the effort mounted by Haywood and several others, including the filmmaker Ken Burns and Senator John McCain, to clear his name. There has been no indication since the tweet as to whether President Trump will follow through. The Justice Department, which typically evaluates such cases, has not commented, nor have White House officials. President Trump in his tweet said the actor Sylvester Stallone had called him about the case. Haywood said she, too, had spoken to Stallone, though it is unclear if Stallone is doing anything else to advance the case. A representative for Stallone said he would not comment for this article and would not confirm the telephone call with the president or with Haywood. A 62-year-old retired clerical worker and part-time seamstress, Haywood has waged her campaign for years, patiently sharing her trove of documents that she says links her lineage to Johnson, giving community talks and news media interviews. For her and others who have campaigned for a pardon, President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mere mention of the possibility was intriguing. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This really could happen, and all it would take would be a presidential signature, ‚<U+0080>ù said Burns, who produced the 2005 documentary ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know is about the sincerity or the spontaneity of it.‚<U+0080>ù Still, the bar for a posthumous pardon is high: Only two have been given by presidents. Haywood discussed her campaign on a recent afternoon at her two-story brick home on the South Side of Chicago, showing a ribald sense of humor and a gift for gab. Her stories unspooled slowly, with winding tangents. The answer to a question about her family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s connection to Johnson included a 20-minute detour through the tale of a physically disabled cousin and discussion of an article she read that said Prince learned to play 27 instruments on his own. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And what again was your question?‚<U+0080>ù Haywood asked when she was done. She said she first heard of Johnson and her connection to him through an uncle when she was 12 and growing up in the Robert Taylor Homes, a high-rise housing project on Chicago‚<U+0080><U+0099>s South Side. Advertisement She was play boxing when her uncle told her the story of how Johnson used to drop in, shower the family with treats, and leave. The story set off a fascination that led her to a library and a biography. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to check books out of the library, ‚<U+0080>ù she said, chuckling and taking a sip of her ice water. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honey, please. I took that little book up under my arm and politely walked my black so-and-so out the library and they have not seen it from that day to this.‚<U+0080>ù Johnson defeated a white opponent, Tommy Burns, for the world heavyweight title in 1908, and his subsequent dominance of the sport gave rise to the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>great white hope‚<U+0080>ù phenomenon. He was one of the most famous people in the United States at the time. In 1910, he defeated the former undefeated heavyweight champion James Jeffries, a fight that caused race riots to break out. During a time of lynchings and other racial animosity, he publicly dated white women, and flaunted his wealth and fame in a way rarely seen then among black public figures. Biographers have noted that he was married three times and routinely beat his wives. In 1912, Johnson was charged with violating the Mann Act, a law prohibiting the transportation of women or girls across state lines for prostitution or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>immoral purposes.‚<U+0080>ù A different former girlfriend, also white, testified against Johnson, who was convicted and then fled the country for seven years. On his return, he served 10 months in federal prison and eventually retired from boxing, eking out a living with sometimes humbling public appearances. He died in 1946 in a car accident at age 70. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is a tragic end to a man that was so great, ‚<U+0080>ù Haywood said. She is frustrated that so few people, particularly young African Americans, seem to know much about Johnson. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They know Floyd Money Illiterate Mayweather, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They know Muhammad Ali. How could you not know the first?‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Haywood learned more from her mother, Dorothy Cross, who started sharing her memories of Johnson with her daughter. Cross‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Luella, was Johnson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s niece. Cross, now 87, lives in a nursing home near Haywood‚<U+0080><U+0099>s home. She has dementia, but when she was shown a picture of Johnson, her eyes lit up. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

When asked why, she smiled a toothless grin. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Money, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. Haywood said she has no doubt about her connection to Johnson. A number of available public records appear to back up Haywood‚<U+0080><U+0099>s claim, but some are riddled with spelling inconsistencies and other discrepancies that make it impossible to confirm the relation. The official record-keeping for black families from that time was also particularly shoddy. Haywood herself possesses family birth certificates, death certificates, photocopies of the local census reports ‚<U+0080><U+0094> some of them provided with help from an official at the National Trust for Historic Preservation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and yellowing photos of Johnson in protective plastic sleeves. But the gaps from that period have made biographers leery of confirming whether she is related. Randy Roberts, who teaches at Purdue University and wrote a biography of Johnson in 1985, said in a telephone interview that Johnson spoke little of his family, aside from his mother. Roberts‚<U+0080><U+0099>s book mentions Johnson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s siblings, but only fleetingly. Still, Haywood presses on. She spends much of her day responding to email and tending to other Johnson affairs, balanced with caring for her elderly mother and a son who has Down syndrome. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My mother cares because she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s looking at his legacy, ‚<U+0080>ù said a daughter, Chianti Tolbert, who lives in Chicago. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even if he wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a great boxer, I think my mother would still be just as aggressive because he is family. I see her do it with other family members.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Johnson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case may have gotten the furthest when McCain, who is a boxing fan and was an amateur boxer at the Naval Academy, managed to get a resolution calling for Johnson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pardon passed by Congress in 2004. (Haywood has appeared at one of McCain‚<U+0080><U+0099>s news conferences.) President George W. Bush never followed up. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t you think this issue says something about the character of America?‚<U+0080>ù McCain said in a 2015 interview with The Times. Ms. Haywood said she was particularly frustrated that President Barack Obama, as the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first black president and an avowed advocate for civil rights, did not issue a pardon. Eric Holder, the attorney general under Obama, told a New York television station in August 2016 that while there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no question‚<U+0080>ù that Johnson was unfairly convicted, Johnson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history of abusing women stood in the way of a pardon. Groups have written to President Trump, who has pardoned three people, urging him to consider the Johnson case. Sam Collins III, the Texas representative for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has organized sending letters to Trump from the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, the Galveston County district attorney, local members of Congress and the mayor. Collins called Haywood an important ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cheerleader for the process.‚<U+0080>ù To Haywood, the long odds and setbacks are just more hardship she has pushed through all her life. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People say when life gives you lemons, make lemonade, ‚<U+0080>ù Johnson said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honey, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve made lemon squares, lemon bars, lemon pie. Lemon cookies.‚<U+0080>ù She said she endured poverty so deep growing up that her mother, who worked a series of low-wage jobs, sometimes could provide only a couple pieces of bread as her school lunch. Advertisement Haywood had her first of four children at 15 and was married at 16. She said ultimately she is not looking to profit from Johnson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fame. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A lot of people on the internet were saying that I should be compensated, ‚<U+0080>ù Haywood said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t expect it, but if it happens it would be beautiful because my family is really indigent to tell you the truth. After he was imprisoned, nothing was ever the same.‚<U+0080>ù If Trump does come through, she has her celebration already planned out.

Its founding chef, Edouardo Jordan, is the first African-American to earn that prize. He also picked up an award for Best Chef in the Northwest for his first restaurant, Salare. With that rare double victory, he found himself in the center of a winnersí circle suddenly filled with women and people of color. The chef and writer Gabrielle Hamilton, who runs just one small restaurant ó Prune, in the East Village of Manhattan, with about 30 seats ó won the national award for Outstanding Chef, a recognition that her influence in the industry far exceeds her footprint. After nine consecutive nominations, Highlands Bar & Grill in Birmingham, Ala., was chosen Outstanding Restaurant, a sweet victory for its founding chef and owner, Frank Stitt. (He was also a four-time finalist for Best Chef in the Southeast, but never won in that category.) The restaurant also earned an Outstanding Pastry Chef title for Dolester Miles, who has been making the restaurantís refined, classic Southern desserts since it opened in 1982. Another pastry chef, Camille Cogswell of Zahav in Philadelphia, was named Rising Star Chef, cementing the dominance of that modern Israeli restaurant, which has won multiple awards for its chef, Michael Solomonov. Belinda Leong and Michel Suas shared the Outstanding Baker award for their modern-French B. Patisserie in San Francisco. While the national awards are handed out to established talents, the coveted regional awards can be a springboard to fame. This year, most went to chefs with relatively new restaurants: Jeremiah Langhorne of the Dabney in Washington D.C., Nina Compton of CompËre Lapin in New Orleans, Dominique Crenn of Atelier Crenn in San Francisco, Missy Robbins of Lilia in Brooklyn, and Gavin Kaysen of Spoon and Stable in Minneapolis. Longer-serving chefs include Karen Akunowicz of Myers & Chang in Boston; Abraham Conlon, who improvises new American food with the Chinese-Portuguese-Indian flavors of the island of Macau at Fat Rice in Chicago; Alex Seidel, who runs a farm and creamery alongside his restaurant Mercantile in Denver; and Rodney Scott, of Rodney Scottís BBQ in Charleston, S.C., long famous for his wood-smoked whole-hog barbecue. Two standard-setters in California won national awards for hospitality: Zuni CafÈ in San Francisco for Outstanding Service, and Caroline Styne, who runs Lucques, A.O.C., and other Los Angeles-area restaurants with the chef Suzanne Goin, for Outstanding Restaurateur. The movement away from elaborate meals and European cuisine continued, as high-end destinations like Spiaggia, the Restaurant at Meadowood, Le Pigeon, Quince and Boka were shut out. (Atelier Crenn is a notable exception.) This yearís roster of winners reflects the forces pushing the industry away from its history of honoring mostly white, male chefs. In this yearís culinary categories (excluding service, design, wine and so forth), 11 of 15 awards went to chefs who are women, or people of color, or both. In the last year, several journalistic investigations revealed that male chefs and restaurateurs, including Beard award winners, had engaged in chronic sexual harassment of female employees and colleagues. The foundation has not revoked the awards bestowed on Mario Batali (Outstanding Restaurateur in 2008 and Outstanding Chef in 2005), Ken Friedman (Outstanding Restaurateur in 2016), and John Besh (Best Chef in the Southeast in 2006). However, this yearís judges, about 600 people including past winners, were instructed to ìbear in mind that award winners are held up as role models. If you have concerns about a chef, restaurateur or beverage professional, or about the culture around a restaurant or restaurant group, leave the person or business out of your nominations.î The chef JosÈ AndrÈs was named 2018 Humanitarian of The Year for his on-the-ground work feeding the people of Puerto Rico after the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Established in 1990, the awards also include book and journalism citations that were presented in New York on April 27. A full list of winners is on the James Beard Foundationís website.

But they just might be the future of Japan. The cylindrical metal products made by Irie Koken Company more resemble Slinkys on steroids than the gee-whiz gadgetry for which Japan was once famous, like Sonyís Walkman, Nintendoís Game Boy and Toyotaís Prius. But they perform the crucial if underappreciated task of helping makers of semiconductors and LCD panels keep their products clean and working. ìThe technology used in making these products is very difficult,î said Norihiro Irie, Irie Kokenís president. ìNot many companies are able to do it.î Some economists and businesspeople believe that slow-growth Japan may be forging a new, critical role in the global economy: making the stuff that makes the stuff for todayís digital revolution. Japan has become an essential supplier of robotics that power assembly lines; electronic systems for cars; circuit boards, sensors and other parts in your smartphone; and a host of other technical components and hardware hidden from the consumerís eye. Japan is moving toward ìan entirely different strategy, where other countries cannot compete,î said Ryoji Musha, president of the economic analysis outfit Musha Research in Tokyo. ìGoing forward, Japan will show a remarkable emergence as one of the locomotives of the global economy.î That would be good news for everyone. Japan remains the worldís third-largest economy, behind only the United States and China. A stronger Japan would offer a badly needed pillar to support global growth and serve as a counterweight to rising Chinese political and economic clout. Bellows and the many other Japanese products like them have already helped buoy the countryís growth. Over the past two years, the economy has experienced the longest continuous expansion since the 1980s. Last yearís 1.7 percent growth rate was the fastest since 2013. Sustaining it wonít be easy. Japanese companies will have to strive to keep their quality edge over low-cost China, which has caught up with Japan in making things like televisions and appliances, as well as over rivals including the United States, South Korea and Taiwan. Japanís image on quality has been hit recently by a number of scandals. More broadly, Japanese society is still shrinking, aging and deeply skeptical of immigrants. That will make it difficult for companies to find enough skilled workers and will put pressure on the countryís leaders to keep its education system up to the task. Many of Japanís biggest players have to look beyond the countryís borders in their quest for growth. Thedeclining population helped drive Takeda Pharmaceuticalís deal on Tuesday for Shire ó the largest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company. ìThe undertow pulling at the dynamics of growth is the main limit to what Japan can do on a sustained basis,î said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of the finance firm Starfort Investment Holdings. Though Japan has some competitive companies that will continue to excel, he said, ìI donít know if that changes the overall equation.î Japan also had several false starts over the past quarter-century, only to stumble back into the doldrums. If this time is different, one big reason will be companies like Irie Koken. Mr. Irie said business had not been this good since he took over as the companyís president 19 years ago. Sales more than doubled in its last fiscal year. ìWe canít catch up with all our orders,î Mr. Irie said. With I.T. becoming more critical to just about every sector and factories looking to improve efficiency, greater demand is expected for robots, chips and other high-tech products ó and the made-in-Japan parts and machines needed to manufacture them. ìEven if there is a recession, I donít see it changing speed right now,î said Rosen Diankov, chief technology officer at the robotics firm Mujin Inc. Mr. Diankov, an American robotics specialist, cofounded Mujin in 2011 with Japanís Issei Takino, a former cutting-tool sales manager, to produce devices that control industrial robots. Its headquarters in a refurbished warehouse in east Tokyo has the hipster vibe of a garage start-up, with offices and workshops cluttered with equipment. Such entrepreneurial companies are all too rare in Japan, where venture capital and risk-taking are scarce compared with the United States or China. But Mujinís founders believe Japan is leading the way in automation, and they wanted to be part of the action. ìWe could have opened our company in Silicon Valley,î said Mr. Takino, who is the firmís chief executive officer. ìOne of the good things about being in Japan is that it is very easy to find a customer.î Mujinís technology can appear retro at first glance. One hand-held remote looks as if it belongs with a 1990s video game console. But Mujin says its advanced components make robots more efficient and easier to use, and are hard for competitors to recreate. The sheer complexity of these Japanese specialties may help the economy maintain a competitive edge. Unlike the TVs, CD players and other consumer electronics that drove Japanís past boom, Mujinís controllers and Irie Kokenís bellows are much harder for manufacturers in China and elsewhere to replicate. When the Beijing-based online retailer JD.com wanted to automate an unmanned warehouse in China, it turned to Mujin. Some of Japanís big corporations are heading in the same direction. The electronics giant Panasonic was once synonymous with TV sets and videorecorders. But over the past six years, it has drastically downsized its consumer businesses ó it no longer sells televisions in the United States at all ó and shifted into industrial electronics, including the batteries for Tesla roadsters and sensors and cameras for automobiles. ìIt is very important to position ourselves wisely,î said Yasuyuki Higuchi, chief executive of Panasonicís connected solutions unit. ìOtherwise, we cannot be competitive.î However, even the most competitive sectors arenít immune from Japanís problems. Severe labor shortages are already plaguing businesses, said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at the research firm Capital Economics, who added that the country isnít welcoming nearly enough foreigners to offset the impact. ìThe demographic headwinds will continue to resist,î said Mr. Thieliant, who estimates that Japanís current spate of growth has already ended. ìIf you donít get more immigrants in, you eventually hit a wall.î Mr. Irie has struggled to find the workers he needs to fill the deluge of new orders. His customers now have to wait twice as long as usual for their bellows ó up to five months. ìThe economy is very good, so good workers are being taken by other companies,î he complained. The shortage has prodded management to invent new ways to attract talent. Mujin employs a chef to cook lunch for the staff every day. Mr. Irie in recent years has taken all of his employees on a Hawaii vacation and renovated the companyís offices. ìThe older employees asked: ëWhy do you have to spend money to make things stylish?íî Mr. Irie said. ìThe image of manufacturing may not be very nice. We want to change it.î He remains optimistic, too. He plans to expand the capacity of his factory in Japan over the next few years, possibly making the firmís largest-ever investment. ìWe are riding a wave,î he said. ìWe can be on this wave because we have something special.î"

Less than six months after his resignation from ESPN, Skipper will soon be competing against his former longtime employer. Skipper was with ESPN for over 20 years and its president for six years. He resigned in December, citing a ìsubstance addiction.î In March, he revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that heíd had a cocaine problem and received unspecified ìtreatment,î and that his resignation followed an extortion attempt by somebody he had bought drugs from. The Perform Group is based in London, with offices around the world. It has a hand in just about every facet of the sports media business. Perform owns sports news properties, including The Sporting News and Goal in the United States; it has extensive investments in sports data, including Opta, a leader in statistical analysis for soccer; it also partners with leagues, including the N.F.L., to sell sports rights worldwide; and it owns DAZN, a streaming sports subscription service. The release announcing Skipperís appointment said that he would oversee all of Performís operations and strategy, but both his statement and that of Simon Denyer, the founder and chief executive of Perform, implied that Skipper would be focusing on DAZN. ìPerform Groupís platform and expertise, coupled with its success in launching subscription services in Germany, Japan and Canada provides a model we intend to replicate around the world,î Skipper said. DAZN, pronounced ìDa Zone,î has been hyperbolically called the Netflix of Sports. Available in five countries ó Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Japan and Canada ó it gives sports fans access to thousands of live sports events for a monthly subscription fee, usually around $20. In Japan, DAZN cornered much of the live sports market, acquiring rights to show the J.League games from 11 of the 12 Nipon Professional Baseball teams, most of the popular soccer leagues worldwide, the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. In Austria and Germany it only has Bundesliga highlight rights but will show the Champions League next year. DAZN launched in Canada last year with N.F.L. rights but has few other top-tier rights and the rollout was plagued by technical issues. Perform hasnít yet announced which countries will be next as part of that global rollout, but it is unlikely that Skipper will soon be engaged in bidding wars against his former company. Most American sports rights are unavailable to be bought for several years."

Now, on the eve of her Senate confirmation hearing, a striking voice is trying to join that fray: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Mr. Mohammed, the principal architect of the Sept. 11 attacks, was captured in March 2003 and tortured by the C.I.A. This week, he asked a military judge at Guant√°namo Bay for permission to share six paragraphs of information about Ms. Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee. Ms. Haspel ran a black-site prison in Thailand where another high-level detainee was tortured in late 2002. But it is not known whether she was involved, directly or indirectly, in Mr. Mohammed‚<U+0080><U+0099>s torture. Mr. Mohammed was held in secret C.I.A. prisons in Afghanistan and Poland. In the weeks after his capture, an Intelligence Committee report said, Mr. Mohammed was subjected to the suffocation technique called waterboarding 183 times over 15 sessions, stripped naked, doused with water, slapped, slammed into a wall, given rectal rehydrations without medical need, shackled into painful stress positions and sleep-deprived for about a week by being forced to stand with his hands chained above his head. Advertisement While being subjected to that treatment, he made alarming confessions about purported terrorist plots ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like recruiting black Muslims in Montana to carry out attacks ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that he later retracted. They were apparently made up, the Senate report said. Ms. Haspel is scheduled to appear before the panel for a confirmation hearing on Wednesday, and several Democratic senators have called for the Trump administration to declassify more information about her involvement in the program to inform the debate about whether she is the right fit for the post. Mr. Mohammed‚<U+0080><U+0099>s request to provide unspecified information to the panel adds a new twist to that debate. It was described by one of his lawyers, Marine Lt. Col. Derek A. Poteet, who is helping to defend him from death-penalty charges before the military commissions system at the Guant√°namo Bay naval station. On Monday, Mr. Mohammed submitted a request to the judge overseeing pretrial hearings in that case, Army Col. James Pohl, Colonel Poteet said. While the file is not public on the commissions docket, Colonel Poteet said it consisted of an expedited motion for permission to provide the information to the committee about Ms. Haspel. The motion, Colonel Poteet said, included an attachment, titled ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Additional Facts, Law and Argument in Support, ‚<U+0080>ù containing ‚<U+0080><U+009C>six specific paragraphs of information‚<U+0080>ù from Mr. Mohammed that his client thinks the Intelligence Committee should know. After Mr. Mohammed raised the idea, his defense lawyers agreed that the information was important, Colonel Poteet said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am not able to describe the information, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. He added that it came from Mr. Mohammed himself, not from files turned over by the government to defense lawyers about the treatment of their client in C.I.A. custody. It is not clear whether Colonel Pohl would rule on the motion before Ms. Haspel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hearing on Wednesday. Asked whether Ms. Haspel had any involvement in Mr. Mohammed‚<U+0080><U+0099>s detention or interrogation, Dean Boyd, a C.I.A. spokesman, said he was prohibited from commenting on her activities in 2003 given the sensitivity of her work. But, he said, on Monday the agency had delivered to the Senate a set of classified documents that describe her 33-year career ‚<U+0080><U+009C>including her time in C.I.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Counterterrorism Center in the years after 9/11.‚<U+0080>ù The files are available to every senator, not just committee members, he said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Mr. Boyd also said the American people would get a chance to hear from Ms. Haspel directly at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She has indicated to the senators she has met with, and will reaffirm tomorrow, her commitment never to restart such a C.I.A. detention and interrogation program, ‚<U+0080>ù he said on Tuesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She remains fully committed to the U.S. laws and Army Field Manuals that govern interrogation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the legal framework in place today.‚<U+0080>ù During the Bush administration, the Justice Department wrote secret memos approving C.I.A. torture techniques as purportedly lawful despite anti-torture laws. The department later withdrew those memos, and Congress enacted a law limiting interrogators to techniques listed in the Army Field Manual. The C.I.A. inspector general later found that agency interrogators sometimes exceeded the limits in the descriptions of techniques provided to the Justice Department for legal analysis. The Senate report also concluded that the C.I.A. misled the White House and other administration officials about its use of such techniques and portrayed them as more effective than they were. Ms. Haspel ran a black-site prison in Thailand in late 2002 while a detainee being held there, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who is accused of orchestrating Al Qaeda‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attack on the American destroyer Cole off the coast of Yemen in 2000, was subjected to torture techniques including waterboarding. She was also involved in destroying videotapes of interrogation sessions in 2005. The agency closed the Thailand prison in late 2002, and Ms. Haspel returned to the Counterterrorism Center outside Washington as a senior operations manager but continued to do temporary assignments overseas. But the details of what she was doing in 2003 are not public. This month, four Democratic senators on the Intelligence Committee ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Kamala D. Harris and Dianne Feinstein, both of California; Ron Wyden of Oregon; and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico ‚<U+0080><U+0094> wrote to Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, asking him to declassify all C.I.A. information related to Ms. Haspel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s involvement in the program before her hearing, since she, as acting director of the agency, has declined to do so on her own. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The American people deserve transparency regarding the background of a nominee who will be asked to represent them, and their values, around the world, ‚<U+0080>ù they wrote, adding, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Without making this information available to the American people, Ms. Haspel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nomination cannot be fully and properly considered by the Senate.‚<U+0080>ù Follow Charlie Savage on Twitter: @charlie_savage."

The meeting in the Chinese port city of Dalian near the North Korean border, came as China tries to regain a central role in the fast-moving diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula. It was announced on Chinaís state broadcaster, CCTV, which said that Mr. Kim arrived in Dalian on Monday and left on Tuesday. Xinhua, the official news agency, reported that Mr. Xi and Mr. Kim ìtook a stroll and attended a luncheon.î It added: ìIn a cordial and friendly atmosphere, the top leaders of the two parties and the two countries had an all-round and in-depth exchange of viewsî on relations between their two countries. The visit came just before Chinaís premier, Li Keqiang, was scheduled to go to Tokyo on Wednesday to meet President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The three are expected to discuss North Korean denuclearization among other issues. Chinese analysts speculated that Mr. Kim went to Dalian to ask Mr. Xi for sanctions relief. At the urging of the Trump administration, China grudgingly voted last year for United Nations sanctions that have hurt the Northís economy, draining its reserves of foreign currency. Mr. Kim recently met Mr. Moon, who is eager to help the North with economic aid. Their meeting also gave the North Korean leader new leverage with Mr. Xi. In essence, Mr. Kim can say that if China does not help ease the Northís economic pain, South Korea will. The two meetings between Mr. Xi and Mr. Kim represent a dramatic change from the frosty period, starting when Mr. Kim took power in 2011, when the two leaders refused to meet each other. In unusually positive language, Mr. Xi said that the North Korean leader had come ìto meet me again just after 40-odd daysî and ìat a crucial time when the Korean Peninsula situation is undergoing profound and complex changes,î according to Xinhua. Chinese state news outlets made pointed references to the fact that Mr. Kim had stayed overnight, making it a longer visit than the one last month between Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon of South Korea. Xinhua quoted Mr. Kim as saying he came to China again to ìstrengthen strategic communicationî with Mr. Xi. But Chinese analysts say the warmth between the two leaders should not be overstated, and that Mr. Kim retains his streak of independence. ìNorth Korea was never a vassal state,î said Shi Yinhong, a professor at Renmin University of China in Beijing. It is even less so now that the United States has agreed to deal with Mr. Kim, he said. By meeting Mr. Xi again, Mr. Kim would also most likely be trying to get Chinaís backing for his diplomatic overtures to President Trump, while assuring China, North Koreaís longtime ally, that it is not being left out of the diplomatic maneuvering with Washington. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim are expected to meet later this month or in June. Hours after Mr. Kim flew home from Dalian, Mr. Trump tweeted that he would speak with Mr. Xi about the visit, as well as trade. Like Mr. Kimís visit to Beijing in March, his visit to Dalian was kept under wraps. But early Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese news service Kyodo reported that a plane from the North Korean carrier Air Koryo was at Dalianís airport. Chinese officials will be heading to Tokyo for meetings on Wednesday with South Korean and Japanese counterparts as part of the recent burst of diplomacy over North Korea. Japan, the host of the talks, has been pushing the United States to continue a tough line against Pyongyang. North Korean state news media on Tuesday criticized Japan for continuing to support tough sanctions against the North, with Rodong Sinmun, the countryís official newspaper, calling it ìtantamount to throwing cold water over easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.î But Mr. Moon, who as South Koreaís leader has pushed for engagement with Pyongyang, urged Japan to consider normalizing ties with North Korea. ìI think dialogue between Japan and North Korea should be resumed,î Mr. Moon said in an interview Tuesday with the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri. ìIf Japan-North Korea relations are normalized, that would greatly contribute to peace and security in Northeast Asia beyond the Korean Peninsula,î he said in written answers to questions submitted by the newspaper. Dalian was also the site of a 2010 meeting between Mr. Kimís father, Kim Jong-il, and Mr. Li, who is now Chinaís premier. The city is a short flight or train ride from Pyongyang, making it a convenient venue for talks between the two nations. Mr. Kim, apparently not as fearful of flying as his father, traveled by plane. His father came to China by a slow-moving train."

Egg timers and onion goggles aside, many tasks can be done with a blade.",Penelope Green,Style,Lifestyle,"Cookware and bakeware, Interior Design, Kitchen","Berries are hot this year, Scott Goldsmith was saying on a recent rain-flecked Friday, brandishing a bright red plastic, wagon wheel-shaped gizmo called a PushBerry, which aims to hull and slice your strawberries in one go. Avocados, still hot, he added, gesturing at the Flexicado and the Avoquado ó two of the many slicers and pitters for sale in his store, all rendered in acid green plastic (designers of kitchen gadgets seem to go in for biomimicry). As for tenacious kale, this decadeís celebrity green, its grooming aids now include the Looseleaf and the Swiftstrip, otherwise known as kale leaf strippers, the solution to a problem you might not know you had. Mr. Goldsmith, 61, is the third-generation owner of S. Feldman Housewares ó a glittering bazaar on Manhattanís Upper East Side ó and an impresario of kitchen gadgetry. On this April morning, his shelves were bursting with esoterica like the billowy yellow silicone Food Pod (a combination steamer and colander that looks like vegetation imagined by the production designers of ìStar Trek,î $14.99); the SpreadTHAT titanium butter knife (ìItís pretty cool,î Mr. Goldsmith said. ìIt uses the heat of your hands. I donít eat much butter, but I donít discriminate,î $19.95); onion goggles ($19.95); and sequined aprons ($120) that were a big hit last Christmas. How do you wash the aprons? ìI have no idea,î he said. Mr. Goldsmithís long retail career spans decades of gadgetry ó including truffle shavers and cherry pitters, Salad Shooters and spiralizers ó and traces a history of ingenuity, optimism and sheer whimsy. If the invention of defoliating devices for cruciferous vegetables causes you to think the makers of kitchen gadgets have finally and collectively lost their minds, Mr. Goldsmith will remind you that his store has been in business since 1929. ìBetween you and me,î he said, ìmost of these things you can do with a knife.î To an industrial designer, the universe of possible kitchen tools is infinite. Very few objects would not benefit from a good rethinking, said Tucker Viemeister, a founder of Smart Design, among other companies, who has reimagined items as complex as a toaster, and as simple as a potato peeler. In 1990, when Smart Designís Oxo Good Grip peeler hit the market, with its fat, comfy rubber handle and fixed blade, it was a kind of revolution. ìOn the one hand, designers are really optimistic because they think they can make things better,î he said. ìOn the other hand, we think everything is wrong or broken.î In ìConsider the Fork: A History of How We Cook and Eatî (2012), Bee Wilson, the English food writer, explored how technology, social mores and food fashions have long collided to create a pageantry of gizmos. New technologies rendered entire categories obsolete; when stoves replaced the open hearth, the hasteners, spits, spit jacks and spit dogs that attended them vanished. Technology has altered the meal itself. After the Cuisinart, we were swimming in purÈes, a situation that Ms. Wilson said had contributed to the robust artisanal fare of today, prized because ìsomeoneís hand had been tired out making it.î As she wrote, ìthe birth of a new gadget often gives rise to zealous overuse, until the novelty wears off.î She continued, ìTo the woman who has just acquired an electric blender, the whole world looks like soup.î In terms of pure function, Ms. Wilson said recently, ìvery few new gadgets are any improvement on a sharp knife, a good source of heat and a dexterous pair of hands.î ìBut they reflect our obsessions and wants at any given time,î she added. ìThe Victorians had slaw cutters, which most of us today manage without, because shredded cabbage is not such a thing. The person who owns a kale stripper is confirming to themselves that kale is a big part of his or her life.î A decade ago, ìhalf the items for sale in cookware shops seemed to be cupcake-related,î she said. ìBut now we have moved on. Veganism seems to be where much of our cooking desire has moved, hence the incredible success of the spiralizer. When they started appearing a couple of years ago, I felt that spiralizers were destined for immediate obsolescence, but I was completely wrong. Maybe itís because of low-carb diets or maybe itís the rise of #plantbased on Instagram, but it turns out that the ability to turn a beet or zucchini into something resembling telephone wire speaks to more people than I ever knew.î Christopher Kimball, the determinedly skeptical cooking program host and co-founder of two food networks based in Boston, Americaís Test Kitchen and Milk Street, identified three categories of kitchen gadgets: Completely Idiotic Useless Objects, Things That Are Not Worth the Storage Space, and Things That Seem Practical But You Could Actually Do Better With a Knife. ìA well-designed tool is immensely valuable,î Mr. Kimball said. ìBut for the specialty items youíre only going to use once a month, how much more work is it not to use it?î Yet Mr. Kimball is not immune to the siren songs of some gizmos. A few years ago, at the International Home and Housewares Show, the food worldís annual gadgetfest held each March in Chicago, Mr. Kimball found himself unexpectedly moved by the BeepEgg, an adorable egg-shaped timer you boil with your eggs. When they have reached the desired degree of doneness ó soft, hard or in between ó BeepEgg plays a tune (like ìKilling Me Softlyî for soft boiled). Mr. Kimball also acknowledged having bought every iteration of egg poacher over the years, even though, as he said, ìat the end of the day, it actually isnít that hard to cook an egg.î In 2016, the last year for which sales figures are available, kitchen tools and accessories represented more than 13 percent of the total housewares pie, which was $87.1 billion, according to the International Housewares Association State of the Industry Report, a 6 percent increase over 2015. Howard Chiu, an engineer who worked in robotics and aerospace, quit his day job two and a half years ago when his invention was a finalist for the Chicago showís innovation award. Mr. Chiu is the man behind the SpreadTHAT, an idea that was inspired by watching his children flay their toast while trying to spread cold butter. Borrowing from his background, he took conducting tubes and coated them with titanium to make a device you could warm with the heat of your hands. SpreadTHAT sold well enough its first year that Mr. Chiu has built a brand around its principles (with products like a gravy warmer, HeatTHAT; an ice cream scooper, ScoopTHAT; a meat thawer, ThawTHAT; and so forth). Ten years ago, Kraigh and Anna Stewart were designing in the furniture industry when they had their ìahaî moment. Ms. Stewart was in the middle of making her grandmotherís recipe for stuffed chicken breasts but didnít have any string or toothpicks. She wondered, Why isnít there something reusable you can tie food up with? ìSilicone had been around for ages,î Mr. Stewart said, ìbut we were the first to use it inside a pan.î They designed their Food Loops (packets of silicone trussing string) in psychedelic hues ó ìfuchsentaî is what they called their first iteration in hot pink ó so you would see them, and not toss them into the trash. ìWe sold half a million that first year, ì Mr. Stewart said. Like Mr. Chiu, the Stewarts quit their jobs and started a company, Fusionbrands, from that first product. The very particular looking Food Pod at Feldmanís is their handiwork (inspired by sea urchins, Mr. Stewart said) as is the EggXactPeel, a slim yellow plastic shell cracker and peeler that was a finalist for an innovation award at this yearís housewares show. Amanda Hesser, the food writer and co-founder and chief executive of Food52, the kitchen and home website, is continually evaluating products like these as her company develops its own for sale. She is an expert on obsolescence, a gimlet-eyed judge of what might have legs. But even Ms. Hesser has a misfit drawer in her kitchen, a mini-museum of the gadgetry of yore. Her particular affliction is melon ballers, including one model with a pea-size scoop (tantalizing for ìThe Borrowers,î perhaps, but otherwise useless). She also has an egg topper, which slices off the caps of eggs with Gallic precision, a butter curler and a shrimp deveiner. Despite a soft spot for such arcana, Ms. Hesser is not tempted by certain new trends. ìOnce you go down the road of having a kale leaf stripper,î she said, ìwhere do you draw the line? This is something we talk a lot about in our reviews. With kitchen manufacturers, there is this tendency to get so detailed and so tailored with their products, everyone would need 5,000-square-foot kitchens. Not to mention youíre missing out on the pleasure of ripping kale off its stem. Youíre letting the tool have all the fun.î Be wary of the rush to judgment, said Cheryl Mendelson, the essayist and novelist. ìOne personís useless gadget often turns out to be the meaning of anotherís life, and my pastry blender was pressed on me with fervent affection by someone who couldnít live without it. I gave it up after one try.î Ms. Mendelson is the author of ìHome Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House,î a passionate guide for the turn of the millennium that was a publishing sensation ó all 896 pages ó when it landed in 1999. The book was notable for its exhaustive rigor ó Ms. Mendelson, who is also a lawyer, teaches philosophy at Barnard College ó but it also showcased her abiding love of cooking. As it happened, she had purged her drawers recently, and some curious items remained: the aforementioned pastry blender, a cherry pitter, two garlic presses, a toast rack and a pasta noodle slicer. Ms. Mendelson said she had once imagined herself as the sort of person who deployed a toast rack at her family breakfast table and made her own pasta. It was these fantasies ó these ideas of selfhood ó that stayed their execution, she said. All of which reminded Ms. Mendelson of a William James joke. Apparently there are two. ìThis is the funny one,î she said. ìJames liked to say that if a philosophical theory was useless, if it didnít do any work in the philosophical sense, it brought to mind the story of the old Irishman who was being carried to a funeral in a broken sedan chair. Because the chair had no floor, the old man had to run along inside it. ëFaith,í the man says, ëif it werenít for the honor of the thing, I might as well walk.íî There is honor in a pasta slicer, Ms. Mendelson added, and so attention must be paid."

That ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cool way‚<U+0080>ù turned out to be a ward at a zoo, now called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll explain: Here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what you ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and Mr. Oliver ‚<U+0080><U+0094> need to know about koala chlamydia. Sadly, yes. Some surveys of koala populations in Queensland have suggested at least half of wild koalas are infected with the disease ‚<U+0080><U+0094> possibly even more. Chlamydia causes conjunctivitis, which can lead to blindness, urinary tract infections and infections of the reproductive organs that can lead to female infertility. Researchers at the University of Sunshine Coast discovered in April that a retrovirus was further weakening koalas, making them even more susceptible to chlamydia. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not just chlamydia; dogs, loss of habitat, rapid urbanization and deaths from vehicles are also killing koalas. In some parts of Queensland, between 1994 and 2016, the koala population declined 80 percent. In 2012, the federal government classified koalas as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vulnerable‚<U+0080>ù in the states of New South Wales and Queensland and in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australia Zoo estimates that 40,000 to 100,000 koalas ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a symbol of Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unique wildlife ‚<U+0080><U+0094> remain in the wild. The usual way ‚<U+0080><U+0094> so stop visualizing it! Though transmitted through sex, koalas have little time for randy rooting, as the Australians call it, because they sleep about 20 hours a day.

Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. There are two main strains of bacteria that lead to chlamydia in the marsupials. The more common strain, Chlamydia pecorum, is responsible for most of the outbreak in Queensland and cannot be transmitted to humans. The second strain, C. pneumoniae, can infect humans if, say, an infected koala were to urinate on someone, though it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unlikely. (Try sharing that tidbit next time a friend sends you a cute koala pic.) Advertisement Baby koalas, known as joeys, can also catch the disease from their mothers while nursing if they come into contact with infected feces. For humans, treatment of the disease involves an embarrassing trip to the doctor for antibiotics (and maybe a few angry texts). Antibiotics are also used to treat koalas, although they do not prevent re-infection and come with a host of unpleasant side effects. Research has shown that the treatment messes with the gut microbes that help them digest their leafy diet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> meaning they can starve. There have been successful trials of a vaccine to prevent infection in both healthy koalas and those in early stages of infection. Some of those experiments have taken place at the very wildlife hospital where Mr. Oliver‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name now adorns the wall. And don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t worry, the Australian government isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t letting Mr. Oliver have all the credit: Just this Monday, the New South Wales government announced a 45 million Australian dollar plan to save the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s koalas. (That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s almost $34 million.) Congratulations, John Oliver, on the koala chlamydia ward named after you https://t.co/p0V1yIIv2r pic.twitter.com/BD69bT3Sul Apart from his name forever memorialized with the words ‚<U+0080><U+009C>koala chlamydia, ‚<U+0080>ù a ward in Mr. Oliver‚<U+0080><U+0099>s honor was donated at the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland.

Marina Abramovic‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Goldberg, ‚<U+0080>ù a high-end sensory-deprivation treatment of Bach‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Goldberg‚<U+0080>ù Variations at the Park Avenue Armory a few years ago, came to mind. But before that Bach performance, all belongings ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even watches ‚<U+0080><U+0094> were shut into lockers so that audience members could be, in theory, fully ‚<U+0080><U+009C>present.‚<U+0080>ù At ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sleep‚<U+0080>ù there were no such restrictions, and the data-saturated listeners, ostensibly approaching Mr. Richter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Magic Mountain to briefly shun modernity, often had their phones out, busily documenting the night in text messages and posts on social media. Some people stood in the center aisle to pose for photos, with the band ‚<U+0080><U+0094> comprising Mr. Richter, members of the American Contemporary Music Ensemble and the soprano Grace Davidson ‚<U+0080><U+0094> visible behind them. Spring Studios‚<U+0080><U+0099> floor-to-ceiling windows offered the cityscape as an alluring backdrop for pajama-clad selfies. For some reason, water wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t available at the bar. I put away my notebook and tried to listen to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sleep‚<U+0080>ù as Mr. Richter intended. For the first half-hour, it was just him at the piano, playing a slow, pulsing lullaby. His rhythmic precision was admirable, given that his score was just stretches of whole notes; he played with the focus of a dyed-in-the-wool Minimalist. Composers from that movement were Mr. Richter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s earliest inspirations. As a boy in small-town Britain in the 1970s, he would get records from his family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s milkman, an artist who was tapped into the music of La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Philip Glass. He fell in love with Satie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s furniture music, and, eventually, the ambient soundscapes of Brian Eno. All of this factored into ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sleep, ‚<U+0080>ù which was first released in 2015. But the piece is also a homage to Bach‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Goldberg‚<U+0080>ù Variations. (The two works have the same number of sections.) While aware that the piece‚<U+0080><U+0099>s origin story is apocryphal, Mr. Richter was intrigued that the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Goldbergs‚<U+0080>ù were supposedly written for a count with insomnia. Bach, it needs be said, this ain‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sleep‚<U+0080>ù is rife with the hallmarks of Mr. Richter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s style: a clarity that can seem like superficiality; an earnestness and emotionality that often come off as more ersatz and manipulative than personal. And it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s difficult to buy into an eight-hour exercise in mindfulness when, against Mr. Richter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s best intentions, it opened itself to being more of a social media sensation. Asked whether the performance could fall victim to the very thing it was trying to resist, Mr. Richter said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fraught with ironies.‚<U+0080>ù But he said he also hoped that the piece could help a community build toward ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a silence.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Silence did reign in the middle of the night, when the piece reached its enchanting apex. Around me people slept, or lay awake as if in a trance. The lofts and office towers of TriBeCa rested, too. There were no stars in the sky, but the lights twinkled in the choppy waves of the Hudson River. I fell asleep, and dreamed that someone was walking among the mattresses, handing out water. Around 5:30 in the morning, the sun began to rise, gradually filling the room with light as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sleep‚<U+0080>ù orchestra played obvious music to match it: an increasingly loud, radiant major chord. If the earlier lullaby music had been purposefully low and mantralike, based on scientific research into what puts us to sleep, this gentle reveille also had an experimental basis: Higher frequencies wake us up. As people awoke, they grabbed their phones to capture the sunrise. A couple kissed and said good morning, as if at home and not surrounded by 100 strangers. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sleep‚<U+0080>ù ended with a fade-out, immediately followed by the voice of a Beautyrest staff doctor, guiding the audience through meditation with the phlegmatic voice ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù actors use to parody NPR.

But on Wednesdays, the Plastics still wear pink.",Carla Correa,Theater,Entertainment,"Mean Girls, Mean Girls, Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, Theater, Movies","Get in, loser. Weíre about to relive the hellish days of high school through the eyes of our favorite queen bees and wannabes. ìMean Girlsî ó the 2004 film that starred Lindsay Lohan as Cady, a new student who tries to navigate the cliques of North Shore High ó has become one of the most quotable films, generating endless GIFs and memes. Now that itís on Broadway, you can sing some of the lines, too. The show was nominated for 12 Tony Awards, including best musical. Hereís your guide to North Shore in 2018. Tina Feyís adaptation for the musical (with music by Jeff Richmond and lyrics by Nell Benjamin) deviates from the movie, but everything is still fetch. Warning: Spoilers ahead. In 2004, Ms. Lohan, then a cog in the Disney machine, was an ìitî girl in Hollywood. Fans liked her because she seemed ó to use a line from Ms. Feyís book ó ìauthentic but not in a fake way.î Being an outsider is in. Janis and Damian take on the part of storytellers, and audiences seemed to like Cadyís ìart freakî friends in this role. Perhaps in 2018 we have less patience for a lead character who fails math to impress a boy. ìWhy are you so obsessed with me?î Regina, the queen bee of North Shore, asked of Janis in middle school, before spreading the rumor that her former best friend was a lesbian. This is why Janis wanted Cady to help her destroy Reginaís reputation. The musical has plenty of girl-power messaging, but it still hinges on the premise that middle school gossip about sexual orientation would define the social dynamics in a progressive community (ìMean Girlsî takes place in Evanston, Ill.). This might have been more plausible in 2004, when expressions of queer identities were less visible and socially acceptable. Yet Regina and others call Janis a ìspace dyke.î Ø\_(<U+30C4>)_/Ø Gretchen was described as being ìtotally richî in the film because her father was the inventor of Toaster Strudel. Gretchen didnít pass up the chance to tell Mr. Duvall, North Shoreís principal, that her father was behind the frozen pastry. Cady still supplies Regina with the fictional Swedish nutrition bars to sabotage her weight-loss goal. (Whatever, present-day Regina is getting cheese fries.) Regina reserved her spring fling dress at 1-3-5, an allusion to the mall retailer 5-7-9, but she couldnít zip it up. The saleswomanís advice: ìYou could try Sears.î The spring fling dress fits just fine. But Regina does wear sweats in the school cafeteria, prompting Gretchen to screech, ìYou canít sit with us!î He was the boy who got four candy cane grams and spurred a thousand memes. But those memes spelled his name wrong. Thatís right, Coccoís name includes two Cís. It always has. But his name wasnít in the filmís credits, so meme-makers guessed the spelling. They guessed wrong. Regina tricked Cady into trash-talking Gretchen while Gretchen was on the line. Cady tricked Regina into trash-talking Gretchen and Karen on a group call. All four used landline telephones. Who uses a landline? LED screens show posts related to what the girls say and do. The limit does not exist! Karen told Cady: ìIím kind of psychic. I have a fifth sense. Itís like I have ESPN or something.î In 2004, many eyes were glued to ESPN. In an era of #fakenews, many eyes are glued to Twitter. Regina jokes that President Trump has blocked her on the site. ìCoach Carr, step away from the underage girls!î The same coach, who said, ìDonít have sex because you will get pregnant and die,î was accused of having inappropriate relationships with two students. References to pedophilia are out in the age of #MeToo. The Burn Book does reveal that Cadyís crush, Aaron, uses a fake address to attend North Shore, so heís expelled. He doesnít even go there anymore! The big questions, though, are why a Burn Book exists in 2018, and why Regina would photocopy its contents instead of posting pages on Instagram. The Plastics danced to the Christmas tune at the winter talent show. Gretchen accidentally kicked the portable CD player, causing the song to skip. Cady saved the day by leading a singalong. The change was a creative decision. And now a boombox doesnít malfunction. (Do boomboxes, like, exist anymore?) Instead, Reginaís skirt pops off, and she is shamed on social media. In the film, Aaron asked Cady what day it is. ìItís October Third,î she said. In the musical, Aaron asks Cady what day it is. ìItís October Third,î she says."

Instead, it revived accusations that Mrs. Trumpís ideas were really coming from somewhere else. Observers on Twitter quickly pointed out that one of the primary materials with ìBe Bestî branding, a booklet on social media guidelines called ìTalking With Kids About Being Online,î had been circulated by the Federal Trade Commission during the Obama era. As the story spread, Mrs. Trumpís communications director published an extraordinary statement on Tuesday that admonished the news media for reporting on the plagiarism claims. ìOur office will continue to focus on helping children, and I encourage members of the media to attempt to Be Best in their own professions,î the communications director, Stephanie Grisham, wrote, ìand focus on some of the children and programs Mrs. Trump highlighted in her remarks yesterday.î Before the official ìBe Bestî rollout on Monday, aides had been upfront to reporters when asked about the fact that Mrs. Trumpís office was repackaging items, including the Federal Trade Commission booklet, from other programs. Among program materials distributed to reporters covering the event was an initiative by the National Safety Council intended to encourage people to talk to their doctors about opioid abuse. Mrs. Trumpís staff plans to continue to solicit ideas for the initiative, which focuses on opioid abuse, social media pressures and mental health issues among young people, from places the first lady has visited. Those include a West Virginia clinic that treats infants born with opioid addiction and a Michigan school where students participate in a program to stress the importance of emotional intelligence and kindness. But critics did not buy the defense. Mrs. Trump enjoys higher popularity ratings than her husband, but she has been accused of plagiarism before. In 2016, a large part of a speech she delivered at the Republican convention appeared to be taken from remarks Michelle Obama, her immediate predecessor, delivered in 2008. On Monday, observers also noted that Mrs. Obama had delivered remarks in 2016 urging men to ìbe better.î Like her husband, Mrs. Trump is also viewed by many as having baggage related to the Obamas, stemming back to jabs she took at President Barack Obama while her husband was promoting the conspiracy theory that Mr. Obama was not an American citizen: ìItís not only Donald who wants to seeî Mr. Obamaís birth certificate, Mrs. Trump said during a 2011 interview. ìItís American people who voted for him and who didnít vote for him.î Mr. Obama eventually released his long-form birth certificate. The East Wing is known to lash out when faced with coverage the first lady views as unfair: In October, Mrs. Trump directed her office to release a scorching statement criticizing President Trumpís first wife, Ivana, for jokingly referring to herself as the first lady. But East Wing aides who had worked to execute a tightly scripted and controlled kickoff ó and who are particularly sensitive when observers draw comparisons to the Obamas ó had not anticipated the negative reaction to the booklet. Different versions of it have circulated since at least 2009, and the booklet is meant to be distributed, as the Federal Trade Commission noted in its own news release on Monday: ìWeíre excited that the first lady is sharing this important information with families across the country,î an agency official, Nat Wood, wrote in a statement. In the version the East Wing distributed on Monday, the only original part appeared to be a brief statement signed by Mrs. Trump. ìThe lessons in this booklet can help kids act thoughtfully and kindly,î Mrs. Trump wrote in a statement at the front of the booklet, which was labeled on the back with the Federal Trade Commissionís logo and web address. ìThe internet ó and technology in general ó are powerful forces for good.î The statement was accompanied by her official portrait."

Rihanna Comes as the Pope.,The annual benefit for the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum takes on a religious theme.,"Jonah Engel Bromwich, Valeriya Safronova",Style,Lifestyle,", Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fashion, Anna Wintour, Rihanna","Each spring, a gala serves as the opening of the annual blockbuster show at the Metropolitan Museumís Costume Institute. Hundreds of celebrities arrive in a frantic seasonal migration for that party. This year, that exhibition is ìHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imaginationî ó and the choice of a religious theme gave a number of gala attendees a hot chance to tee off to the line of reporters on the eventís packed red carpet on Monday night. ìIím a pagan,î said the actress Frances McDormand. ìArenít you?î ìThis is like my skin, Iím proud to be in it,î said Lena Waithe, the actress and writer, who was regally dressed in a black suit and cape that became a broad rainbow. ìIíve got the community on my back to make sure they know Iíve got them all the time.î ìThe theme to me is like be yourself,î Ms. Waithe said. ìYou were made in Godís image, right?î Not every outfit was political. ìIím the back wall of the Sistine Chapel,î said Ariana Grande, the singer, whose dress was a mass of papal conclave color. ìI feel fairly important in this outfit, I have to say.î Building a relationship with the Catholic Church took significant work by the Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton. Eventually, the church lent more than 40 items to the exhibition, which encompasses an enormous 58,600 square feet and extends to the Cloisters. A papal tiara, with 18,000 diamonds, was flown to New York with a bodyguard. The Met Gala may be the worldís fanciest party. The ceremonial red carpet procession was to be followed by cocktails, then dinner (lobster with gold flakes was on the menu), then a dessert buffet. President Trump proposed to his wife, Melania, there in 2004. Tickets are $30,000, but you canít just buy one ó Anna Wintour, the artistic director of CondÈ Nast who is one of the chairwomen, approves attendees. And its red carpet entrance is one of the premier showcases of celebrity brands, for musicians, actors and fashion folks alike. ìThis carpet is one of the most important carpets of the year,î the model Bella Hadid said. A staff member dipped to adjust the train of the designer Ariana Rockefeller, David Rockefeller Jr.ís daughter. ìLeave her alone, sheís perfect,î a photographer shouted. ìWe based the dress on a tapestry from the Cloisters museum,î Ms. Rockefeller said. ìAnd of course my great-grandfather John D. Rockefeller Jr. founded the museum, so we really wanted to incorporate family history as well as honor the theme tonight.î Unlike in the Crusades themselves, there was very little blood shed this evening. ìThey had to sew me in on the way here,î said Olivia Munn, who was bleeding very slightly. Her dress was inspired by Crusade-era chain mail, by H&M. ìItís sewn into my head,î Ms. Hadid said of her veil. She was wearing Chrome Hearts. ìThe things we do, darling.î And, in what has become something of a tradition, one attendee used the night to seize attention. While all these celebrities flirted with the theme of Catholicism this year, none took it on as fearlessly as Rihanna, a chairwoman for the event who dressed like the female pope the Vatican has never had. Rihannaís hat was reminiscent of the papal tiaras worn by popes from the medieval era until the mid-1960s. Others were ready to take the evening less seriously. Favorite part of the night? ìEating a vegan cheeseburger right before,î said the poet Cleo Wade. Eva Chen wore an outfit inspired by Joan of Arc and said the bathroom was the place to be. ìThe secret is that is where people are partying,íí she said. ìNo, Iím joking.î Where were his kids, George Clooney was asked? ìTheyíre under the dress,î he said, waving toward the enormous train on the outfit worn by his wife, Amal, one of the eventís chairwomen. ìI forgot my ticket, do you think theyíll let me in?î asked the performer Rita Ora as she approached the entrance to the Met. They might, if they know who you are! But a feeling of religiosity did suffuse the evening. Katy Perry arrived in enormous white feathered wings. ìI feel very angelic, celestial, ethereal,î Ms. Perry said on the red carpet. ìYeah, I love God,î said the comedian Tiffany Haddish. ìGod love me ó look at my career.î The event is underwritten by Christine and Stephen A. Schwarzman, and by Versace. In addition to Rihanna, Ms. Wintour and Ms. Clooney, Donatella Versace is also a chairwoman. Ms. Wintour has led the gala since 1999. The event, said Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, ìhas gotten better and better each year.î"

This joint federal and state program doesnít care whether youíre white or black, Christian or Muslim, Republican or Democrat, a city dweller or a rural resident. In states that expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare, all you have to be is poor enough to qualify. But maybe not in Michigan. Last month, the State Senate passed a bill that would require Medicaid beneficiaries to find work or else lose their coverage. The bill, now under consideration in the Michigan House, has come under fire for harming the poor and disabled, as well as for burdening struggling families with needless paperwork. More than 100,000 people may lose health instance if it passes. Thereís another flaw in the bill, however, one that exposes it to serious legal challenge: Itís racially discriminatory. Many of the legislators supporting Michiganís work requirements come from rural districts with high unemployment. Many of those districts are predominantly white. To protect their constituents, these legislators have included a safety valve in the bill: If you live in a county with a high unemployment rate (over 8.5 percent), youíre exempt from the work requirements. The rationale? When there are no jobs to be had, it doesnít make sense to punish you for not working. Yet that safety valve does not apply equally. Specifically, it does little for Michiganís black residents, who are concentrated in cities like Detroit, Muskegon and Flint. Those cities suffer from chronically high unemployment rates, but theyíre all in counties with low rates. The city of Flint, for example, has an unemployment rate of 10.4 percent; but in Genesee County, where Flint is located, the rate is just 5.8 percent. The upshot is that no one in Michiganís biggest cities can take advantage of the safety valve ó even if thereís no work to be had. The racial consequences are unmistakable. Those in predominantly white rural counties with high unemployment are exempt from the work requirements. Those in predominantly black cities with high unemployment are not. Perhaps the discrimination is unintentional. But from the perspective of civil rights law, that makes no difference. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits recipients of federal funds ó including state Medicaid programs ó from employing ìmethods of administration that appear neutral but have a discriminatory effect on individuals because of their race.î Thatís according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency responsible for overseeing Medicaid. And Michiganís bill presents exactly the sort of discrimination that Title VI outlawed: Itís a county-level exemption that ìappears neutralî but has a ìdiscriminatory effect.î Could the courts step in if Michiganís bill passes? We think so. The Supreme Court has held that Michigan officials canít be sued for this sort of Title VI violation ó in the legal lingo, thereís no ìprivate right of actionî for violating the statute. But Michigan needs a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services before it can move ahead with work requirements. As with most kinds of federal agency action, the decision to issue a waiver can be challenged in court, and will be invalidated if the court finds the agencyís decision ìarbitrary.î It would be the height of arbitrariness ó and hence unlawful ó were the Department of Health and Human Services to bless a state policy that so flagrantly violates the agencyís own anti-discrimination rules. If Michigan wants to accommodate rural counties with stubbornly high unemployment, itís not hard to come up with an alternative approach: It should simply extend the same accommodation to its metropolitan areas. Not only is that the right thing to do, itís also what the civil rights laws demand. Thereís a deeper lesson here. If work requirements were a good idea, conservative Michigan legislators wouldnít need to exempt their rural constituents. Theyíd just offer a tough-love message: If you want health insurance on the public dime, you should move to a place where you can find work. Thatís not the message, though. The message, instead, is that work requirements are good for people who live in hard-bitten cities and bad for those who live in hard-bitten counties. That canít be right, and not only because of its racial overtones. The right answer is that work requirements arenít good for anyone ó wherever you happen to live and whatever your skin color happens to be."

Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who has risen to prominence as an antagonist of the Trump administration and a defender of womenís rights, faced calls for his resignation after four women accused him of physically assaulting them in an article published Monday by The New Yorker. Two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, who spoke on the record to the magazine, said they had been choked and hit repeatedly by Mr. Schneiderman. Both said they had sought medical treatment. Another woman, a lawyer, said she was slapped violently across the face. A fourth woman also said she had similar experiences. All the women in the article, who had been romantically involved with Mr. Schneiderman, said the violence was not consensual. Mr. Schneiderman denied abusing the women, saying in a statement: ìIn the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.î Within hours after the allegations were made public, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who like Mr. Schneiderman is a Democrat, called for him to step down. ìMy personal opinion is that, given the damning pattern of facts and corroboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as attorney general,î Mr. Cuomo said. The call was echoed by Sonia Ossorio, the president of the New York arm of the National Organization for Women, which endorsed Mr. Schneiderman in both his 2010 and 2014 campaigns. ìThe evidence is overwhelming,î she said. ìHe can no longer serve. He must step down immediately.î Mr. Schneiderman, the chief law enforcement officer of the state, who was widely seen as harboring ambitions to be governor himself one day, is up for re-election this year. No Democrats have declared an intention to challenge him in the primary; Manny Alicandro, a corporate lawyer from New York City, is running as a Republican and officially declared his candidacy on Monday. If Mr. Schneiderman does not resign, the Democratic-controlled Assembly could vote to impeach him. A trial would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, which would be joined by judges from the stateís highest court, the Court of Appeals. A two-thirds vote would be required to remove him. Mr. Schneiderman had been previously outspoken about womenís issues, announcing, for instance, a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. ìWe have never seen anything as despicable as what weíve seen right here,î Mr. Schneiderman said then. Since 2017, Mr. Schneiderman had also raised his profile nationally by taking on President Trumpís agenda repeatedly in the courts. He is pushing to change state law so that his office could prosecute Mr. Trumpís aides even if the president pardoned them. Ms. Manning Barish, in The New Yorker account, described being slapped by Mr. Schneiderman after they had both been drinking; she and Ms. Selvaratnam said several of the attacks occurred after alcohol had been consumed. ìIt was horrendous,î she said. ìIt just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fiber, I felt I was being beaten by a man.î Debra S. Katz, a lawyer for Ms. Manning Barish, said that it was Mr. Schneidermanís ìfantasy and his fantasy alone that the behavior was welcome.î Mr. Schneiderman, she continued, ìhas made a career railing against this type of abuse. Yet apparently he intends to revictimize these courageous women who have come forward by pulling out that age old sexist trope that they wanted it.î Both Ms. Manning Barish and Ms. Selvaratnam have in recent days repeatedly declined to comment when reporters for The Times asked them to address the allegations. ìAfter I found out that other women had been abused by Attorney General Schneiderman in a similar manner many years before me, I wondered, whoís next, and knew something needed to be done,î Ms. Selvaratnam said in a statement released Monday night. ìSo I chose to come forward both to protect women who might enter into a relationship with him in the future but also to raise awareness around the issue of intimate partner violence.î Ms. Manning Barish also followed the articleís publication with a post on Twitter, saying that she ìcould not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me.î A former wife of Mr. Schneidermanís was taken aback by the allegations being leveled against him. ìIíve known Eric for nearly 35 years as a husband, father and friend,î said Jennifer Cunningham, his ex-wife and frequent political strategist. ìThese allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values and a loving father.î Mr. Schneiderman has long been regarded as one of the stateís most progressive politicians, even before his 2013 lawsuit against Trump University and his subsequent suits against the Trump administration made him the darling of the political left. Last fall, Mr. Schneidermanís office proudly pointed to a segment on the late-night comedy show ìFull Frontal with Samantha Bee,î in which the attorney general was described as ìa hero who stood up to democracyís nemesis,î a Superman-like character known as Schneider-man. His credentials as an advocate for women, in particular, had gone unquestioned. In 2010, as a state senator from Manhattan, he introduced a bill to make intentional strangulation to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. That same year, the National Organization for Womenís New York branch endorsed him in his successful bid for attorney general, citing his ìunmatched workî in ìprotecting women who are victims of domestic abuse.î For several years, his office has published a ìKnow Your Rightsî brochure for victims of domestic violence. ìWe must recognize that our work keeping New Yorkers safe from domestic violence is far from over,î Mr. Schneiderman said in the announcement for the 2016 brochure. At the direction of Governor Cuomo, he is currently reviewing the 2015 decision by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her. Some national Republicans were gleeful at the allegations. The Republican research shop America Rising quickly packaged Mr. Schneidermanís ties to other prominent national Democrats. And on Monday evening, Mr. Trumpís son, Donald Trump, Jr., dug up an old tweet from Mr. Schneiderman in which he said ìNo one is above the lawî and tweeted at him, ìYou were saying???î"

Levine,N.Y. / Region,US,NYC,"Good morning on this radiant Tuesday. If ever there were dÈcor to match this weekís weather, itís at Kabisera Kape on the Lower East Side. The new coffee shop at 151 Allen Street ó a hole-in-the-wall smaller than a subway car ó is covered top to bottom with pop art so cheery and so gaudy that it seems less like a New York City storefront and more like a psychedelic Amsterdam cafe. Step inside for your morning fix and youíre met by a laughing sun, smiling mushrooms, flowers with faces and energetic coffee beans ó some meditating and bathing, others flying with angel or butterfly wings. In place of the acoustic guitar soundtrack youíd find at a Starbucks, you hear chirping birds. ìItís like visual Prozac,î said the artist Peter Marco, who, over his 30 years on the Lower East Side, has become known to neighbors simply as Marco. ìThe style is very simplistic, very cartoony ó a baby could draw it ó but itís all about the message,î he told us. ìWith this place, itís about looking into yourself and realizing your own potential, which you could probably figure out just by reading the walls.î (Among the inscriptions: ìTo know where we are going, we must know where weíve bean.î) Marco was working a local construction job in the 1980s when he noticed artists selling their paintings along a fence by Prince and Greene Streets in SoHo. Then a 21-year-old whose tiny Clinton Street apartment doubled as an amateur art studio, Marco carried one of his pieces to the fence, attached it with some clothespins, sold it for $150, and has been painting on the Lower East Side ever since. The neighborhood remains his favorite gallery in the city. ìAs someone whoís from Manhattan, Iíve seen this place change a lot,î Marco said, noting the cityís dangers (and that he was robbed many times) in the 1970s. ìTalk about change: You now have bike lanes and people playing with their laptops, having cappuccinos. Given that massive change, the Lower East Side hasnít changed at all; it was immune to Giuliani and Bloombergís beautification. Itís still pretty raw. And thatís why Iím still here.î Today, Marco, 50, lives above the coffee shop with his wife, Jeanette, 43, who is from the Philippines and moved to New York City three years ago. Their apartment is an artistic extension of the cafe. No matter the weather or time of day in New York City, a sun shines over their living room, running the length of the ceiling. The walls are covered with blue sky and clouds, and living in this perfect world are octopuses with mustaches, flying pigs and other googly-eyed, giggling critters. ìIn our bedroom we have our moon, the sky and the stars,î Ms. Marco said. ìIt makes me really happy waking up in the morning.î ìYou canít not feel good in that kind of environment,î Marco added. ìI donít see how thatís possible.î Hereís what else is happening: The sunny streak continues. Blue skies, a light breeze and a high around 70 today, with things heating up even more tomorrow. (Hereís your allergy forecast.) Now out you go. ï New Yorkís attorney general, Eric T.

In addition to long-established taxis, livery cabs, black cars and limousines, they can summon rides through Uber, Lyft, Via, Juno and other app-based ride-hailing and ride-sharing services. While this new surfeit of options has been a boon to people trying to get around town, it has also helped lay waste to the livelihoods of taxi drivers and turn New Yorkís already busy streets into glorified parking lots ó and leaders like Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Albany and the City Council have yet to come up with an effective strategy to deal with these problems. Cities have a long history of intervening to impose order on their streets. No large metropolis can accommodate everyone who would like to drive or be privately driven around ó street space is a limited resource, especially in the densest neighborhoods and at the busiest times of the day. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, New York created its taxi medallion system because drivers looking for work flooded the streets, far outstripping demand and driving down wages for drivers. With the rise of Uber, Lyft and the like, the city is again confronting a tragedy of the commons. Many other thriving cities, including London and Paris, are also struggling to figure out how to respond to these new business models. A big part of the problem is that elected officials have not updated regulations written for a bygone era in which each type of car service tended to stay in its lane, so to speak ó in New York, taxis primarily plied the streets of Manhattan and the cityís airports, liveries took care of residents of the other boroughs, and black cars chauffeured the denizens of Wall Street. While the city has issued just 13,587 taxi medallions ó a small fraction of the more than 60,000 cars Uber commands ó it gave freer rein to the liveries and black cars under the assumption that these specialized services would never become dominant. Ride-hailing apps have shattered those boundaries by signing up drivers with livery or black-car licenses. These companies cast themselves as filling big gaps in the transportation system, and itís true that they have been great for people in mass-transit-starved parts of the city. But their growth has also led to many veteran taxi and black-car drivers seeing a devastating decrease in take-home pay. Thatís largely because they are completing fewer trips than before. As a result, the value of the taxi medallions that drivers must either buy from the city or rent from taxi companies has crashed in recent years, going from a high of about $1.3 million in 2014 to less than $200,000 today. Over the past five months, four drivers who were financially strained have killed themselves, and many others have lost their medallions to foreclosure. At the same time, traffic has slowed to a crawl, to just 8.2 miles per hour south of 60th Street in Manhattan in 2015, down from 9.4 miles per hour in 2010, according to the cityís Department of Transportation. It makes little sense for the city to regulate the old and new guard of for-hire cars differently when many New Yorkers use them interchangeably ó as do some drivers, who have been known to switch between traditional cabs and app-based services. While it would be impractical for the city to get rid of its existing regulations in one fell swoop, it could phase in new regulations. A more thoughtful regime would ensure that all drivers make a living wage by establishing a minimum fare for riders, and a standardized share of that fare for drivers, regardless of what kind of car they drive. Or as Brad Lander, a City Council member from Brooklyn, has proposed, the city could require companies like Uber to pay drivers a minimum wage. Further, the city ought to standardize regulations like those requiring that a certain number of cars be accessible to people with disabilities. The city and state also need to create a smart congestion pricing plan to reduce traffic while raising money for upgrades to the subway and bus system, which would encourage fewer people to get into cabs and Ubers. The Legislature recently added a surcharge on taxi trips below 96th Street in Manhattan: 75 cents for pooled trips, $2.50 for yellow taxis and $2.75 for black cars and Uber and Lyft rides. This charge is flawed. It does not vary by the time of day, and lawmakers failed to impose fees on private cars and trucks. A smart pricing scheme would discourage use of all vehicles when traffic is at its worst and encourage car travel and deliveries at off-peak times. Over time, the city should consider whether it owes something to drivers who sunk their savings into taxi medallions. Many drivers went into debt to buy these permits because the city promised them a monopoly on picking up passengers, a promise it has not been able to keep. No doubt any compensation plan would be controversial, and working out the details would be tricky ó the city, for example, should not compensate investors, like Michael Cohen, President Trumpís lawyer-cum-fixer, who should have known that they were taking big risks by buying up dozens of medallions. Governments in Quebec and Australia have compensated or are proposing compensating taxi drivers for the lost value of such licenses. The city needs to make its transportation system fairer to paid drivers, responsive to the needs of commuters and more environmentally sustainable. If the mayor and other elected officials put their minds to that task, they might also help set a model that cities around the world could follow."

Kuznetsov took a lead pass from Alex Ovechkin and tucked the puck underneath Matt Murray at 5 minutes 27 seconds, ending Pittsburgh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s two-year reign as Stanley Cup champion and propelling the Capitals into the N.H.L.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s final four for just the third time in franchise history. Braden Holtby stopped 21 shots for the Capitals, who will face Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference finals.

The Penguins, by contrast, had been impossible to finish off since Coach Mike Sullivan took over in December 2015. Pittsburgh came in 4-0 in elimination games under Sullivan, including a 2-0 victory in Game 7 in Washington last spring. The stakes led to an unusually slow start for both before the Capitals broke through 2:13 into the second when Walker held off Pittsburgh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Derick Brassard behind the Pittsburgh net and fed Chiasson in the right circle.

The departures follow six others.,"Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper",Business Day,Business,"Nike, Sexual harassment, Appointments and Executive Changes, Discrimination,, Mark G Parker,,,,","A sweeping investigation into workplace behavior at Nike has resulted in the departure of four more top-level executives, raising to 10 the number of senior managers to leave the company as it continues to overhaul its upper ranks amid widespread allegations of harassment and discrimination against female employees. Together, the departing executives oversee some of the most important business categories and highest-profile departments at the worldís largest sports footwear and apparel company. The four additional people who have either left the company already or will depart soon, Nike confirmed on Tuesday are Steve Lesnard, the head of running in North America; Helen Kim, who oversaw Eastern North America; Simon Pestridge, a head of marketing for the performance categories; and Tommy Kain, Nikeís director of sports marketing. In a companywide address last week, Mark Parker, Nikeís chief executive, apologized to employees and said that departures related to the companyís broad investigation into workplace behavior would be completed by this week. Inside Nike, the new departures may provide more reassurance to employees seeking signs that Mr. Parker is trying to address the workplace problems that have plagued the company in recent years. But for Wall Street, the internal turmoil could be worrisome and prompt questions about whether Nike will have the leaders it needs in place to execute its aggressive business strategy. Six top executives have previously left the company or have said they would leave in connection with the investigation. In March, Nike announced the departures of Trevor Edwards, the president of the Nike brand and a potential successor to Mr. Parker; and Jayme Martin, who oversaw many of Nikeís global businesses. Other managers who subsequently left included the head of diversity and inclusion and a head of footwear. The latest departures come amid a rash of rumors and speculation that more managerial changes are in store at the companyís Beaverton, Ore., campus in the wake of a revolt, led by women, that is shaking up Nikeís executive ranks. Earlier this year, a group of women at the company began an informal survey that sought input on discrimination and sexual harassment at the company. The survey was presented to Mr. Parker on March 5, and 10 days later, the executive shake-up began with the announcement that Mr. Edwards was resigning. The moves come a little more than a week after The New York Times, using interviews with more than 50 current and former Nike employees, reported about womenís complaints of being marginalized, harassed and thwarted in their careers at the company, and about indignities that included humiliating visits to strip clubs and unwanted kisses. Many of those interviewed said when they took their grievances to human resources, they seemed to not be taken seriously."

The companyís president has personally apologized to the men.",Matthew Haag,Business Day,US,"Nordstrom, St Louis, Race and Ethnicity, Discrimination, Blacks;African-Americans, Retail,,,","The president of Nordstrom Rack flew to St. Louis to apologize on Tuesday to three black friends who were falsely accused last week of trying to steal clothing at one of the companyís stores. The teenage friends had stopped into a Nordstrom Rack in suburban St. Louis on Thursday to look for last-minute deals before a high school prom on Friday night. Two employees followed them throughout the store, closely monitoring their every move, and reported them to the police. ìEvery time we moved, they moved,î Mekhi Lee, 19, told KMOV-TV in St. Louis on Tuesday. When they left the store ó carrying items they had just purchased ó police officers were waiting for them outside. For many minorities, what happened at Nordstrom Rack illustrated a disheartening everyday truth about racial discrimination in the United States, where merely entering a store is enough to draw suspicions. The experiences are not new, but the rise of cellphone video has helped highlight recent cases, including the arrest of two black men last month at a Starbucks in Philadelphia. The episodes can also quickly morph into disastrous situations for companies, spurred by bad employees in one store whose actions are caught on video and risk blemishing an entire organizationís reputation. Executives at Nordstrom heard about the encounter later on Thursday. The next day, the companyís president, Geevy Thomas, called and apologized to Mr. Lee, a freshman at Alabama A&M University, and the other men, Dirone Taylor and Eric Rogers, both seniors at De Smet Jesuit High School, a private school in St. Louis County. ìWe did not handle this situation well, and we apologized to these young men and their families,î a Nordstrom Rack spokeswoman said in a statement. ìWe want all customers to feel welcome when they shop with us and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind.î The company is investigating the actions of its employees during the episode. The men could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Mr. Thomas and other Nordstrom officials flew to St. Louis on Monday and met with store employees on Tuesday morning to discuss what happened. Later on Tuesday, Mr. Thomas was scheduled to meet with the men, their families and local leaders, including Adolphus M. Pruitt II, the president of the St. Louis chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Pruitt, who met with the friends after the episode, said that both the police and the men handled the situation perfectly. Inside the store, as the two employees were following them, the friends debated leaving but decided they would buy some items to show that the employees had been wrong, that they were not stealing and that they had money to spend, he said. When the police arrived, the men cooperated with the officers, showed them their receipts and let them look inside their shopping bags and car, he said. The officers stressed that they were called out only because an employee had called 911. The police realized they were not thieves and let them go. ìThey allowed them to tell their side of the story, and the police told their side of the story,î Mr. Pruitt said on Tuesday. ìIn todayís day in time, it is remarkable. If we can get that to repeat itself as much as possible, boy, it would make my job easier.î While Mr. Pruitt said he was disappointed by the employees at the store, he said he was encouraged by the companyís response. ìIt does demonstrate that they are reacting in the right way,î he said, comparing its response to that of Starbucks after the arrest in Philadelphia. But he added that the recent cases underscored the need for employees to receive racial-bias training, which Starbucks will conduct on one day later this month for workers in more than 8,000 stores in the United States. Nordstrom has been reviewing its employee policies and considering changes to training at both its department stores and Nordstrom Rack, its discount shops. ìBlack children ó black teenagers and black males, especially ó are looked at this way at retail stores all across the country,î Mr. Pruitt said. ìWhat are they going to do that goes beyond employees at one store?î Bryant Marks, a social psychologist at Morehouse College and a founder of the National Training Institute on Race and Equity, said that company executives had quickly understood that they must react swiftly to these cases. ìCorporate leadership will continue to have a rapid response to these incidences as to not appear to be tone deaf regarding race and bias in America,î Mr. Marks, who trains groups on implicit bias, said in an email. ìThis is somewhat of a wake-up call for large corporations. I say somewhat because the vast majority of them have diversity officers or units already in place, but in my experience, I find those units to be underfunded and their work to be low priority.î"

At the urging of Senator Mitch McConnell, Mr. Trump implored voters to oppose the former coal executive Don Blankenship, above, who was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety rules after a 2010 explosion that killed 29 people. A number of states are holding primary elections on Tuesday that carry big implications for this fallís midterms, which could see Republicans lose control of Congress. The president signaled that anxiety on Twitter, lashing out at prosecutors leading the Russia inquiry and asking if ìthis Phony Witch Huntî would affect the elections. Hereís our fact check of his claims about two former F.B.I. officials. _____ 2. ìThe security aspect is smoke and mirrors.î That was a former top aide to Scott Pruitt, the secretive chief of the Environmental Protection Agency. Newly disclosed emails show that the agencyís close control of his public events is more about avoiding tough questions from the public than about security. Here are highlights from the documents. Mr. Pruitt, above in front of an image of Yosemite National Park, currently faces 11 investigations into his spending and management at the E.P.A. Carrying out the Trump administrationís agenda with less controversy: Mick Mulvaney, the interim chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We looked at how heís dismantling an Obama-era watchdog agency vilified by Republicans. _____ 3. The future of the Iran nuclear deal should be clearer tomorrow. President Trump, above, said he would announce at 2 p.m. whether he would pull the U.S. out of the 2015 pact. Diplomats told us that he appeared inclined to scrap it and reimpose sanctions on Iran. But it was uncertain if he might moderate that move, perhaps by allowing European nations to have economic relations with Tehran without being penalized by the U.S. Worries about the deal pushed prices for American crude oil above $70 a barrel for the first time since 2014. _____ 4. The rapid spread of H.I.V. is threatening an entire indigenous population in Venezuela. Collapsing government programs, shortages of medicine and a lack of information have contributed to the epidemic plaguing Warao villagers in the isolated Orinoco Delta. ìIím like a soldier without a weapon,î lamented a nurse who needed far more antiretroviral drugs. ìI canít do anything.î _____ 5. ìThereís no sign of it slowing down.î The erupting Kilauea volcano in Hawaii continues to spew lava into residential neighborhoods and has destroyed nearly three dozen buildings so far. Hundreds of earthquakes have hit the island of Hawaii, and officials have warned of the threat of high levels of deadly sulfur dioxide gas. Watch video of the eruption. _____ 6. The National Rifle Association announced its next president, and itís a familiar name. Oliver North, above, who rose to prominence in the 1980s for his role in the Iran-contra scandal, will take the helm of the gun rights organization in a few weeks. In recent years he has been active as a political commentator, author and television host. Heíll be taking over at a politically delicate time, after a spate of mass shootings. _____ 7. With lethal injection facing mounting problems, states are moving toward an untested alternative: execution by nitrogen gas. Oklahoma, Alabama and Mississippi have authorized such use of nitrogen and are developing protocols to use it. Itís a leap into the unknown, as there is no scientific data on the proposed method. Unlike lethal injections, which have caused agony for condemned inmates, death from nitrogen is thought to be painless. But some medical experts are skeptical, and nitrogen is not used in states where medically assisted dying is legal. _____ 8. At 22, heís one of the best players in college baseball. But as a teenager he pleaded guilty to molesting his 6-year-old niece. Luke Heimlich, above, a pitcher for Oregon State, now denies committing the crime and has his sights set on the major leagues. Most Oregon State fans are standing behind him. The victimís mother, however, said last year that she was ìappalledî that he was still on the team. Separately, in a case watched closely by other colleges, Massachusettsís highest court ruled that M.I.T. could not be held responsible for the suicide of a student in 2009. _____ 9. If California were a country, it would have the fifth-largest economy in the world. The stateís growth has reinforced a liberal narrative, that a state with a big government can still have a booming economy. Strict environmental protections, a progressive tax policy and an ascendant minimum wage havenít slowed the surge. Prosperity has come with pain: traffic, property prices, homelessness. But the stateís economic success has underpinned its defiance of the Trump administration. Above, downtown San Francisco. _____ 10. Finally, would you undress for a museum tour? Our writer did just that along with 161 other people at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Working with a nudist group, the art museum invited naked visitors on a tour of exhibitions focused mostly on political strife and resistance. A guide said: ìI am hoping the experience of leaving their clothes at the door will help them leave some part of their identity with it, and experience it with more openness.î Have a great night. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

Vogel",Climate,Domestic Politics,"Environment, Threat, EPA, Scott Pruitt, US Politics","Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON ó The Environmental Protection Agency had a total of 33 threat investigations underway as of mid-March ó 10 of them involving Scott Pruitt from the last six months ó a security assessment released Monday shows, offering the most detailed tally yet of threats against the agencyís top official. The memos, provided to The New York Times in response to a Freedom of Information request, are the documentation that Mr. Pruitt has pointed to in justifying the round-the-clock security he has received since taking over the agency in February 2017, as well as first-class flights he has taken, among other unusual security expenses. The memos also show the degree to which Mr. Pruitt is not the first E.P.A. administrator or agency employee to receive threats. The total number of threat investigations by the agency has fluctuated from 47 in fiscal year 2015 to 43 in 2016 to 50 in 2017, most of which was during the Trump administration. The records, released Monday, include summaries of the number of threats received, as well as copies of incident reports in which agency investigators followed up. The threats were received in the form of Twitter messages, emails, postcards and phone calls, among other methods, including at least one threatening letter from an inmate, which was ìforwarded back to prison officials,î according to one memo. The inspector generalís office investigated the threats with other federal agents, often interviewing the individuals who made the threats by traveling to their homes in locations including Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The investigators appeared to err on the side of recommending criminal cases against them, though federal prosecutors often rejected the recommendations. Thatís what happened in the case of someone who sent a ìpotentially threatening postcardî to Mr. Pruitt. During an interview at the home of the sender, the person ìexpressed regret and apologized for sending the postcard,î according to the memo, even as the person ìwas wearing two handguns on [his or her] waist.î The documents redact names and other information, including gender, that could be used to identify the people who made the threats. The United States attorneyís office also rejected a recommendation to prosecute a person who sent an email to Mr. Pruittís predecessor, Gina McCarthy, who served under President Barack Obama. The email had the subject line ìBan glyphosate or die you haggard nazi bitch! DIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIEDIE.î Glyphosate is a herbicide. When the sender, who was later determined to have sent threatening emails to Hillary Clinton, then a presidential candidate, and also to have ìmental instabilities,î was interviewed at home, there was an assault rifle standing in the corner of the room, the memo indicated. However, the sender told investigators that he or she ìwould not hurt anyoneî because the individual ìdoes not leaveî the house. Another case that was declined by federal prosecutors was described as resulting from a social media post stating that the person ìis not happy with some of [Mr. Pruittís] policies and wanted to express [his or her] displeasure,î according to the memo. Other threats appear to have targeted Mr. Pruittís family, including one expressing hope that a family member ìdies soon, sufferingî as others watch ìin horror for hours on end.î The investigation into that threat is continuing, the memo states. Separately on Monday, the agency released a memo that had been used to justify Mr. Pruittís first-class flights, signed by Pasquale Perrotta, who served as Mr. Pruittís chief of security until late last month. ìWe are requesting that the EPA Administrator be strategically seated in business and or first class seating when on official travel,î said the May 2017 memo from Mr. Perrotta, which was released to The Washington Post, also as a result of a Freedom of Information request. The memo cited a ìlashing out from passengers which occurs while the Administrator is seated in coach,î and went on to say that continued use of ìcoach seats for the Administrator would endanger his life.î The decision to have Mr. Pruitt fly only first class as well as questions about the security threats are now being investigated. According to the memos detailing threats against Mr. Pruitt, in some instances the inspector generalís office declined to pursue them. They included a letter that was ìfull of disjointed threatsî but that ìwas not considered by the EPA OIG to contain an actual threat,î and a postcard that called Mr. Pruitt ìevil incarnateî but that could not be traced to the sender. Tension has surfaced in recent months between two divisions at the E.P.A. charged with trying to secure agency employees. The inspector general has emphasized the growing number of threats, while the Office of Homeland Security, which is actually charged with making threat assessments, has concluded that many of the alleged threats are just private individuals sounding off in ways that are protected by the First Amendment. ìEPA Intelligence has not identified any specific credible direct threat to the EPA Administrator,î a February memo from the homeland security office said."

But a funny thing happened: Voters realized that repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean taking health insurance away from tens of millions of Americans. They didnít like that prospect ó and enough Republicans balked at the backlash that Obamacare repeal fizzled. But Republicans still hate the idea of helping Americans get health care. So instead of releasing the kraken, theyíve brought on the termites. Rather than trying to eliminate Obamacare in one fell swoop, theyíre trying to undermine it with multiple acts of sabotage ó while hoping voters wonít realize whoís responsible for rising premiums and falling coverage. Which is why itís important to place the blame where it belongs. The first thing you need to understand is that Obamacare has been a highly successful program. When the legislation was passed, Republicans insisted it would fail to cut the number of uninsured and would blow a huge hole in the federal budget. In fact, it led to major gains in coverage, reducing the uninsured rate to its lowest level in history, at relatively low cost. Itís true that the coverage expansion was somewhat less than originally predicted, although the shortfall was much less than you may have heard. Itís also true that after initially offering surprisingly cheap policies on the Obamacare exchanges, insurers found that the people signing up were sicker, on average, than they expected, leading to higher premiums. But as of last year, the markets appeared to have stabilized, with insurers generally profitable. Nobody would claim that Obamacare is perfect; many Americans remain uninsured, and too many of those with coverage face troublingly high out-of-pocket expenses. Still, health reform delivered most of what its advocates promised and caused none of the disasters its opponents predicted. Yet Republicans still want to destroy it. One reason is that much of the coverage expansion was paid for with taxes on high incomes, so repeal would be a way to cut taxes on the wealthy. More broadly, conservatives hate Obamacare precisely because it works. It shows that government actually can help tens of millions of Americans lead better, more secure lives, and in so doing it threatens their low-tax, small-government ideology. But outright repeal failed, so now itís time for sabotage, which is taking place on two main fronts. One of these fronts involves the expansion of Medicaid, which probably accounted for more than half the gains in coverage under Obamacare. Now a number of Republican-controlled states are trying to make Medicaid harder to get, notably by imposing work requirements on recipients. What is the point of these work requirements? The ostensible justification ó cracking down on able-bodied Medicaid recipients who should be working but arenít ó is nonsense: There are very few people meeting that description. The real goal is simply to make getting health care harder, by imposing onerous reporting and paperwork requirements and punishing people who lose their jobs for reasons beyond their control. The other front involves trying to reduce the number of people signing up for private coverage. Last year the Trump administration drastically reduced outreach ó the effort to let Americans know when and how to get health insurance. The administration is also promoting various dodges that would in effect let insurance companies go back to discriminating against people in poor health. And when Congress passed a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy, it also eliminated the individual mandate, the requirement that people sign up for insurance even if theyíre currently healthy. Preliminary evidence suggests that these efforts at sabotage have already partially reversed the coverage gains achieved under Obama, especially among lower-income Americans. (Curiously, all the coverage losses seem to have happened among self-identified Republicans.) But the worst is yet to come. You see, G.O.P. sabotage disproportionately discourages young and healthy people from signing up, which, as one commentator put it, ìdrives up the cost for other folks within that market.î Who said that? Tom Price, President Trumpís first secretary of health and human services. Sure enough, insurers are already proposing major premium hikes ó and they are specifically attributing those hikes to G.O.P. actions that are driving healthy Americans out of the market, leaving a sicker, more expensive pool behind. So hereís whatís going to happen: Soon, many Americans will suffer sticker shock from their insurance policies; federal subsidies will protect most of them, but by no means everyone. Theyíll also hear news about declining insurance coverage. And Republicans will say, ìSee, Obamacare is failing.î But the problem isnít with Obamacare, itís with the politicians who unleashed this termite infestation ó who are doing all they can to take away your health coverage. And they need to be held accountable."
124,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:07,13:16:54,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/books/review-warlight-michael-ondaatje.html,A Mother Keeps Wartime Secrets in Michael Ondaatjeís New Novel,"In ìWarlight,î a man and his eccentric friends look after two teenagers in London after the childrenís parents leave home for mysterious reasons.",Dwight Garner,Books,LIfestyle,", Michael Ondaatje, Books","Michael Ondaatjeís early books had such evocative titles, one had to pick them up and hold them for a while. ìThe Collected Works of Billy the Kidî (1970) is a black-powder mix of poetry and prose, history and myth. His novel ìComing Through Slaughterî (1976) ó for my money, Ondaatjeís masterpiece ó is a surround-sound tour of the troubled New Orleans cornet player Buddy Boldenís life. His 1979 book of collected poems is called ìThereís a Trick With a Knife Iím Learning to Do.î As Ondaatjeís titles have settled ó recent ones include ìAnilís Ghostî and ìDivisaderoî ó his prose has settled as well. By now we know what we are going to get from an Ondaatje novel: A moody, murky, lightly pretentious and mostly nonlinear investigation of lives and stories that harbor tantalizing gaps. There will be disquisitions on arcane topics including, frequently, mapmaking. Wartime and/or criminality will feature in the foreground or background. The nature of storytelling will be weighed and found fascinating. The spine of the plot, unlike the spine of a steamed fish, will be nearly impossible to remove whole. Ondaatje, who is from Canada by way of Sri Lanka, is best known for ìThe English Patientî (1992), which won the Booker Prize. The novelís story was tidied up considerably by the director Anthony Minghella, whose film version won the 1997 Academy Award for best picture. Ondaatjeís new novel, ìWarlight,î is his best since ìThe English Patient.î That sounds like a publicistís dream quote, but perhaps it isnít exactly. I was among that sodality of readers who didnít cotton to ìThe English Patient,î finding it merely moody, murky and lightly pretentious, a tone poem in search of a whetstone. ìWarlightî reads, at its not-infrequent best, like a late-career John le CarrÈ novel. It hooks you in ways that make its quiet storm of bombast (ìHe always knew the layered grief of the world as well as its pleasuresî) almost possible to bear. The novel commences in bombed-out London, directly in the wake of World War II. Cans of beans are heated on gas rings. The parents of two teenagers break a bit of bad news: For a year the parents are leaving the children, Nathaniel and Rachel, behind to live in Singapore, where the father has been promoted to run a Unilever office. This bookís resonant first sentence puts the situation this way: ìIn 1945 our parents went away and left us in the care of two men who may have been criminals.î One of these two men is Walter, whom the kids nickname ìThe Mothî because he is said to be ìmoth-like in his shy movements,î a description I never entirely understood. (He flies into candles?) He has a large nose, keeps curious hours and knows disreputable characters. The other man, Norman, is nicknamed the Pimlico Darter. He uses a mussel boat to smuggle greyhounds at night into London for racing, and Nathaniel becomes a willing accomplice. These menís friends begin appearing in the house as well, all of them eccentric and accomplished in unpredictable ways, like a houseful of Ricky Jays. ìThe house felt more like a night zoo,î Nathaniel says, ìwith moles and jackdaws and shambling beasts who happened to be chess players, a gardener, a possible greyhound thief, a slow-moving opera singer.î Nathaniel relishes his time with this Dickensian band of misfits. The Moth and the Darter are rough-hewn father figures to him. Rachel, however, is bereft. She will never forgive her parents for abandoning her. When the teenagers find that Rose, their mother, has left her steamer trunk behind ó she had ostentatiously packed it in front of them ó they become suspicious about her whereabouts. It slowly leaks out that sheís not in Singapore but apparently doing dangerous postwar intelligence work. The men in the house are men she trusts, having worked beside them during the war. The teenagersí lives may be in danger. Thereís a kidnapping scene. People will try to kill Rose as well. Later in life, Nathaniel will work in intelligence himself, in part to try to tease out Roseís many wartime secrets, what he calls ìthe obscure rigging of our motherís life.î ìWarlightî moves at a clip that, in Ondaatje terms, can be said to be breakneck. He writes well about all sorts of things, from British private schools to river navigation to how large restaurants operate. Heís a devotee of curious detail. This story is, however, told at a distance ó from Nathanielís perspective, years after the action. About almost everything, there is more telling than showing. Thereís an unpleasant sense that Ondaatje is regaling us rather than simply putting across a story. In his overweening interest in secrets and tall tales, in his relish for how stories are told, heís taken the Salman Rushdie exit off the Paul Auster turnpike. Novels about storytelling are nearly always the ones to avoid, the way that one learns to steer clear of Martin Scorsese movies (ìHugoî) that are more or less explicitly paeans to the movies. Everything in this novel seems to be lit by amber light, rather than the flat light of sober observation. Humor is scarce. The disreputable characters invariably have hearts of gold. Words like ìmagicalî and ìwondrousî and ìsacredî pop up more often than you wish they would. People utter things like ìYou have a quiet heartî and ìThere are always miracles hereî and ìHe knew the real and urgent world was the sea.î It is as if your oysters have arrived not with lemon quarters but with a squeezable bear of honey. Ondaatje loves people who are incorrigible, who know how to live slightly outside the law and who have, in Lester Bangsís phrase, some Looney Tunes in their souls. Yet his burnished, lukewarm sentences donít snap to life like the people he enjoys. Reading him on these scruffy men and women is like listening to someone try to play ìLong Tall Sallyî on solo cello. Itís not awful, but itís weird."

Stone Jr., the self-described political dirty trickster who has served as an informal adviser to President Trump, sought on Monday to portray his contact with a Trump campaign aide as minimal in response to a report that the special counsel is scrutinizing their ties. Mr. Stone made the comments after a CNBC report that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing on links between him and Rick Gates, the deputy campaign chairman. Mr. Gates pleaded guilty in February to financial fraud and lying to investigators in the Russia inquiry and is cooperating with the special counsel. Those links included dinners before and after the campaign, according to CNBC, which cited unnamed people with direct knowledge of the matter, but Mr. Stone said in an interview that he recalled eating only one meal with Mr. Gates in 2016. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Gates story is somewhat perplexing, ‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Stone, who spoke by phone from his New York apartment, where he had downtime as he promoted a new book. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I only have a record of one dinner with Rick Gates, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that the guest list included two other political operatives: Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide who was recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigators, and Paul Manafort, who soon after took over as chairman of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campaign. But Mr. Manafort canceled at the last minute, and Mr. Gates, his deputy, attended in his place. Mr. Stone said the conversation during the dinner, which fell soon after the New York primary in April 2016, was about the New York State delegate selection for the Republican National Convention. The operatives expressed concern about whether delegates, at a time of deep division among Republicans, would be loyal to Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vision for the party, Mr. Stone said. Mr. Mueller has tried to ascertain what, if anything, Mr. Stone knew in advance about a cache of stolen Democratic emails posted by WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with what Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigators have asked witnesses. In a speech during the summer of 2016 and in Twitter messages before the emails were made public in October, Mr. Stone appeared to foreshadow their release. Those emails were made public within hours of a Washington Post report revealing the existence of a tape of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Access Hollywood‚<U+0080>ù footage featuring old audio of Mr. Trump speaking in vulgar terms about women. But Mr. Stone has insisted that he had no prior knowledge and that he was acting off what the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, had said publicly that summer, as well as information from his longtime associate Randy Credico, who had contacts close to Mr. Assange.

Advertisement Mr. Stone said he never had any relationship with Mr. Assange.

The testimony addressed one of Mr. Stone‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweets about the hacked emails, which were stolen from the account of Hillary Clinton‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Two months before the emails were released, Mr. Stone predicted on his since-suspended Twitter account that it would soon be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Podesta‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time in the barrel.‚<U+0080>ù The tweet, his lawyer said, contained a grammatical error ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the apostrophe. Mr. Stone had meant that to write that it would soon be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Podestas‚<U+0080><U+0099> time in the barrel‚<U+0080>ù and was attempting to refer to Mr. Podesta and his brother, Tony, a major lobbyist, his lawyer said. Mr. Stone, a veteran political operative, has spent years weaving narratives about himself, and others ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a talent he acknowledges may have succeeded too well this time, harming him in the process. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I put it this way ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m a showman, and the only thing worse in politics than being wrong is being boring, and I have dramatized some of what I believe to be true, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Stone said. He was adamant that he had not changed his story. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I have clarified things, when questioned, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. One person who has yet to question him is Mr. Mueller; Mr. Stone said he still had not heard from the special counsel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office.

Donít mess with what works.,Ellen R. Wald,Opinion,International,"Oil and Gasoline, IPO, Politics, Saudi Aramco, Mohammed bin Salman, Ali Al- Naimi, Saudi Arabia","For almost 40 years, Saudi Aramco has operated with a tremendous degree of independence for a national oil company. That has worked well for the company and for the country: Aramco has prospered financially and almost single-handedly funded the Saudi state and the royal family. But that could all be changing. Mohammed bin Salman, the hugely popular crown prince, is reshaping his country, and he seems intent on putting his stamp on Aramco. There are signs that the government is exerting new control over Aramcoís most fundamental decisions. This is a mistake. Too much interference could destabilize the company and, by extension, a large part of the Saudi economy. When it comes to the future of Aramco, the government in Riyadh needs to let the professionals do their jobs. Aramco is unique among national oil companies. Rather than seizing the company through nationalization, the Saudi government purchased Aramco from its American owners in transactions in the 1970s. The Saudi leadership in the 1970s insisted on a legal purchase to avoid disrupting a hugely profitable enterprise. After the purchase, the Saudi government essentially left the business to Aramco employees who were, at the time, a mix of American and Saudi managers. In less than a decade, Saudi executives took the reins. Many of them had worked their way up within Aramco starting when they were teenagers. The professional oilmen were in charge. The company was owned by Saudi Arabia, but it collected its own revenue and controlled its own finances. Ali al-Naimi, Aramcoís chief executive from 1988 to 1995, told me recently that the Saudi finance ministry tried to co-opt the companyís finances in the 1980s. ìWhat they wanted was all the income to come to the ministry and they dole out our expenditures,î he recalled. ìI said no way. The income comes to us and we give you royalty, taxes and dividends from our profits. We cannot have the income come to you directly.î The king at the time, Fahd, sided with Mr. Naimi, because he understood that Aramcoís independence was vital to the success of the venture and thus the wealth of the Saudi state, people and royal family. With financial independence came strategic independence. Aramco developed and carried out a plan to expand globally. Under Mr. Naimi and his successors, the company became the most influential in Asia, supplying huge amounts of crude oil to refineries it purchased in China and South Korea. It even gained control of the largest oil refinery in the United States through maneuvers beginning in the late ë80s. Aramco executives also invested heavily in research and technological innovation. The company now says it hopes to preserve Saudi Arabiaís natural resources and prolong its position in the energy industry past the 70 years its oil reserves are expected to last. Even without the pressure of politics or investors, and without meaningful regulation, Aramco has worked to protect the environment, for example through carbon-capture technology and solar power. Rather suddenly, in January 2016, an announcement upended this tradition of independence. In what seemed like an offhand remark during an interview with The Economist magazine, Prince Mohammad, then just 30 years old and the deputy crown prince, announced that Aramco would go public. The company seemed unprepared to answer basic questions and issued a statement saying that additional examination was needed. Ever since, Aramcoís plans have looked uncharacteristically disorganized. A lot of money has been paid to banks and consultants to facilitate an initial public offering, but there has been little guidance or information about when, where and how it will happen. Indeed, different parties within the Saudi government have openly discussed conflicting priorities for Aramcoís I.P.O. The Saudi finance minister has indicated that the company may sell stakes to Chinese interests in a private deal. There are reports that Prince Mohammed wants to list Aramco on the New York Stock Exchange, but that the oil minister believes the London Stock Exchange would be better. Just last week, the chief executive of the Saudi stock exchange said it is prepared to handle Aramcoís listing on its own. When Aramcoís current chief executive, Amin Nasser, is asked about the I.P.O., he simply says that itís up to the ìshareholder.î Therein lies the problem. The company has always made its own decisions about its next steps. It is now waiting for direction from the outside. Even the identity of this ìshareholderî is unclear. Who really owns Aramco? The official company line is that it is owned by the Saudi government. But what does that mean? Mr. Naimi made sure that the finance ministry stayed far away from Aramcoís revenue, and although the oil ministry represents Saudi Arabia in OPEC, it does not determine Aramcoís strategy. When I asked Aramcoís vice president of strategy and markets, Yasser Mufti, he said that the Saudi Aramco Supreme Council, headed by Prince Mohammed, acts as the ìshareholder representative.î The councilís traditional role is just to approve Aramcoís spending plans and select new members for the companyís board. In April, this council appointed new board members, including the first woman and two high-ranking government officials close to Prince Mohammad. The Saudi kings have always protected Aramcoís independence because Aramcoís profits made them strong. Now, the royal family and the state bureaucracy are exerting their control and the relationship is changing. Prince Mohammad explains that he is ridding the kingdom of its ìaddiction to oilî and is diversifying the economy. But right now, and for the foreseeable future, Saudi Arabia still depends on Aramco for its wealth, and the monarchy depends on that wealth for its power. Without a strong, independent Aramco, power could be precarious."

But this past semester, inspired by the #MeToo movement, students began aggressively calling attention to their grievances. They posted the names of the teachers on social media. Three students complained to the schoolís Title IX office, which looks into reports of harassment or sexual misconduct. In one complaint, Dominique Machain said that in 2016, when she was a freshman, Roy Frumkes, her narrative writing professor, told her in graphic detail about a student he said had gone to his apartment and had sex with him. Then, she said, he added that if she wanted a recommendation she should visit him there. The implication, Ms. Machain said, was clear. ìI almost felt paralyzed,î she said. In recent weeks the school responded, saying Mr. Frumkesí employment had been terminated after an investigation found that he had violated the schoolís sexual misconduct policy, according to a letter from an administrator. The letter did not detail the findings. Mr. Frumkes, who did not respond to requests for comment, is appealing. The schoolís letter said that until his right to appeal has lapsed or been exhausted his employment would be suspended. Another instructor in the department, Robert Haufrecht, was suspended in March and his contract was not renewed. The school said the suspension was in response to concerns raised by students but did not detail them. One student, Ashley Priessnitz, said she had complained last semester that Mr. Haufrecht, her acting teacher, had showed her unwanted attention, and had told her in class to rehearse suggestive scenarios, like washing herself. ìI started wearing baggy clothes to class because any time I wore normal clothing he would comment on my appearance,î Ms. Priessnitz said. ìIf I saw him in a hallway at school I would duck around a corner.î Mr. Haufrecht declined to comment. Several weeks ago, an administrator in the film and animation department, Mary Lee Grisanti, wrote to students, referring to Mr. Haufrecht. ìI want you to know that your voices have been heard by this school at the highest levels,î she said. The schoolís response illustrates the ripple effect of the #MeToo movement, which surfaced in the high-profile precincts of Hollywood but is now prompting action in more prosaic places like colleges and businesses. The School of Visual Arts, with more than 4,000 students from around the world, was founded in 1947 as the Cartoonists and Illustrators School and offers a variety of degrees. ìThe College is firmly committed to the rights of all members of its community,î Joyce Kaye, a spokeswoman, wrote in an email. ìSVA responds to sexual misconduct complaints swiftly, investigates them thoroughly and resolves them in accordance with local, state and federal laws.î Ms. Kaye did not respond to questions about Mr. Frumkes. The schoolís film and animation program offers courses in screenwriting, cinematography and directing. Among its alumni are the horror director Ti West; Dan Minahan, who has directed episodes of ìGame of Thrones,î and ìHouse of Cardsî; and Michael Giacchino, a composer who was named to the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2015. Several students and former students said they were frustrated by the schoolís response when they complained in the past. One former student, Courtney Wilder, said she had complained to Salvatore Petrosino, an administrator in the film and animation department, almost two decades ago when, she said, Mr. Frumkes made her feel uncomfortable by calling her in her dormitory, inviting her to his apartment and giving her presents in class. She said Mr. Petrosino told her that he would talk to Mr. Frumkes, but that no one followed up with her. ìIt really shook my confidence as a young woman,î she said, ìwhat people see as your value and who you can trust.î The school is now investigating Ms. Wilderís complaint. Mr. Petrosino did not respond to phone and email messages requesting comment. In recent weeks the schoolís president, David Rhodes, wrote Ms. Wilder to apologize for her treatment by faculty and staff. ìI thought that I had cleaned house in 1996,î he said. ìObviously I was wrong.î The recent complaints about Mr. Frumkes came in earlier this year. Ms. Machain and a second student, Sofia Zarul Azham, said they realized that they each had similar experiences with him. Ms. Zarul Azham said that Mr. Frumkes had asked her to his apartment, invited her to a restaurant and once commented on her breasts. The two women decided to go together to the Title IX office, accompanied by a professor, Nana Simopoulos, who acted as their adviser. ìHe made me uncomfortable many, many times,î Ms. Zarul Azham said of Mr. Frumkes."

A media report on a sexual assault case raises questions on sexual consent.",Adam Baidawi,World,International,"Rape, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Australia, New South Wales, Sydney","MELBOURNE, Australia ó A Sydney rape case that dragged out for almost five years ó through two trials, a conviction, two appeals and the suspectís eventual acquittal ó has set off a flurry of debate in Australia on what constitutes sexual consent. The issue was reignited by a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporationís flagship news program, 4 Corners, highlighting the case of Saxon Mullins, who was 18 when she said she was raped in a nightclub alleyway. On Tuesday, the morning after the television report ran, the attorney general of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, announced a review of the stateís sexual consent laws. Mark Speakman, the attorney general, said that the state had a ìsystemic problem with sexual assault reporting and convictionsî and that the conviction rate in such cases was around 55 percent. The contentious issue of what constitutes sexual consent, and whether or not the law properly reflects contemporary sexual encounters, was at the core of the winding case involving Ms. Mullins, who went public for the first time in the dramatic TV report. Ms. Mullins asserted on the program that at a Sydney nightclub in 2013 she met Luke Lazerus, then the 21-year-old son of one of its owners. He invited her to see a ìV.I.P. areaî and guided her to an alleyway. There, they began kissing, before, she said, Mr. Lazerus demanded that she get on her knees, and proceeded to rape her anally. She said she was a virgin at the time. Ms. Mullins told the news program she was on ìautopilot,î wanting to get away. She said she thought, ìJust do what he says, and then you can go.î She added: ìI just kind of froze, you know. I was just trying to, like ó and I know it doesnít make sense but ó block it out. Just wait till it was over.î In the trial that followed, a jury convicted Mr. Lazerus, despite his testimony that Ms. Mullins never said ìstopî or ìno.î He spent 11 months in jail before he won a jury-less retrial, where he was acquitted. State prosecutors pushed for a third trial, but an appeals court deemed the request unfair. The legal process lasted almost five years. In acquitting Mr. Lazerus, Judge Robyn Tupman said that testimony from a female friend of his about sex on a first date had given her ìinsight into contemporary moralityî ó conveying Mr. Lazurusís hyperaggressive behavior as within the bounds of modern sexual norms. While Judge Tupman acknowledged that Ms. Mullins did not actively consent to the sex, she said her ruling focused on whether or not Mr. Lazerus knew she had not consented ó a wrinkle that many view as a main limitation of the law. Australiaís laws on the issue vary by state and territory. In announcing the commission into sexual consent laws, Pru Goward, the New South Wales minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, said she believed the state should model itself after the state of Tasmania, where sexual consent needs to be active. ìYou must explicitly ask for permission to have sex. If itís not an enthusiastic yes, then itís a no,î Ms. Goward said. ìThe Tasmanian legislation is probably the most victim-centered,î said Helen Cockburn, a lecturer in criminal law at the University of Tasmania. ìWhere the victim is passive, thereís a presumption that theyíre not consenting.î In many other Australian jurisdictions, courts will look to see whether the victim actively resisted, in order to satisfy that they were nonconsenting, Dr. Cockburn added. But discussion, too, has swelled around sexual culture in Australia, and whether changing the law can effect the change that victims of sexual violence seek. ìLaw reform is not necessarily going to give us the answers that we want,î Dr. Cockburn said. ìI think there are problems around consent literacy.î Ms. Mullins said in the televised interview that a bit of education could clear up a lot of uncertainty. ìEnthusiastic consent is really easy to determine. I think if you donít have that, then youíre not good to go. ìAll you need to say is, ëDo you want to be here?í And, very clearly, ëDo you want to have sex with me?íî Kate Bettes, 24, a journalism student in Sydney, said: ìI think itís not only the laws, but the understanding and culture around consent in Australia, and around the world, that are horribly confusing. It should not only be ëNo means no,í but more importantly, ëYes means yes,íî she said Groups pushing for tighter laws also say that a fundamental paradigm shift is needed in Australia. ìPeople are still going to blame victims,î said Nina Funnell, the director of End Rape on Campus Australia, an advocacy group. ìUnless we address those attitudes and beliefs surrounding consent, very little will change.î"

Embiid chirped at Celtics forward Marcus Morris, who flashed a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>3-0‚<U+0080>ù with his hands. McConnell buried a 3-pointer for a 14-point lead that would soon make that combination obsolete. Brown was desperate to jolt the Sixers, benching the slumping Robert Covington (0 for 14 combined in Games 1 and 3) for McConnell. McConnell, an undrafted third-year guard, had started 68 games combined over the last two seasons and served as an example of the type of player ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Process‚<U+0080>ù was built on.

Rozier shoved Embiid in the chest with his right hand, and the two quickly had to be separated. Rozier and Embiid were hit with technicals. Then they both hit 3s.

I want to focus less on the impact of his work, which is all around us, and more on how he did it, because heís a model of how you do social change. Stewart Brand was born in Rockford, Ill., in 1938, the son of an advertising executive. By the early 1960s, he felt alienated from boring, bourgeois suburbia and concluded that Native Americans had a lot to teach the rest of us about how to lead a more authentic way of life. In 1965, he created a multimedia presentation called ìAmerica Needs Indians,î which he performed at the LSD-laced, proto-hippie gatherings he helped organize in California. Brand then had two epiphanies. First, there were no public photos of the entire earth. Second, if people like him were going to return to the land and lead natural lives, they would need tools. He lobbied NASA to release a photograph of the whole earth, which became an iconic image for the environmental movement. Then he slapped the picture on the cover of what he called the ìWhole Earth Catalog.î The catalog was an encyclopedia of useful items for people heading to a commune ó home weaving kits, potterís wheels, outdoor gear. But it was also a bible for what would come to be known as the counterculture, full of reading lists and rich with the ideas of Buckminster Fuller and others. ìWhole Earth Catalogî sold 2.5 million copies, won the National Book Award and defined an era. When a culture changes, itís often because a small group of people on societyís margins find a better way to live, parts of which the mainstream adopts. Brand found a magic circle in the Bay Area counterculture. He celebrated it, publicized it, gave it a coherence it otherwise lacked and encouraged millions to join. The catalog featured an iconic central character, the Cowboy Nomad, who served as symbol and role model. Brand took influences from different parts of America ó the New York art world, farmers, academic visionaries like Marshal McLuhan ó and synthesized them into one ethos. He crowdsourced later editions, asking readers to recommend other cool products to feature. The communes fizzled. But on the other side of the Bay Area, Brand sensed another cultural wave building. Back in the 1960s, computers seemed like the ultimate establishment device ó IBM and the government used them to reduce people to punch cards. But Brand and others imagined them launching a consciousness revolution ó personal tools to build neural communities that would blow the minds of mainstream America. As Fred Turner says in ìFrom Counterculture to Cyberculture,î ìWhat the communes failed to accomplish, the computers would complete.î Brand played cultural craftsman once again, this time first as a celebratory journalist. In 1972 he wrote a piece for Rolling Stone announcing the emergence of a new outlaw hacker culture. The hackers were another magic circle on the cutting edge of the future, a circle Brand would publicize and inspire others to join. As my Times colleague John Markoff, who is writing a biography of Brand, notes, Brand is a talented community architect. In the 1970s, he was meshing Menlo Park computer geeks with cool hippie types. The tech people were entranced by ìWhole Earth,î including Steve Jobs and Frederick Moore, co-creator of the celebrated Homebrew Computer Club. Brand meshed the engineers with the Merry Pranksters and helped give tech a moral ethos, a group identity, a sense of itself as a transformational force for good. In 1985, Brand and Larry Brilliant helped create the Well, an early online platform (like Usenet) where techies could meet and share. He helped Kevin Kelly organize hacker conferences, which attracted media attention. As Silicon Valley became more corporate in the 1980s and 1990s, he also helped form the Learning Conferences, Worldview Meetings, the Global Business Net and other convenings that gathered the multidisciplinary theorists and journalists who would define the wired culture: Kelly, Esther Dyson, Tim Berners-Lee and Nicholas Negroponte. Brandís gift, Frank Foer writes in ìWorld Without Mind,î is ìto channel the spiritual longings of his generation and then to explain how they could be fulfilled through technology.î Innovations donít just proceed by science alone; as Foer continues, ìthe culture prods them into existence.î Turner argues that Brand has always craved a sensation of wholeness, a feeling of belonging and authenticity. He has found communities that gave him that sensation and has encouraged millions to love what he has loved. He synthesized a cultural ethos, and then tried to embody and spread that ethos through festivals, conferences and organizations. Brand vehemently disagrees with me, but Iíd say that, more recently, the computer has also failed as a source of true community. Social media seems to immiserate people as much as it bonds them. And so thereís a need for future Brands, young cultural craftsmen who identify those who are building the future, synthesizing their work into a common ethos and bringing them together in a way that satisfies the eternal desire for community and wholeness."

Sunís sentence handed down by the intermediate court in the northern port city of Tianjin appears to end a career that had once been seen as propelling Sun to the apex of power in the ruling Communist Party. In addition to being imprisoned, Sun was deprived of political rights for life and all his personal property was confiscated. State broadcaster CCTV showed Sun in court accepting the sentence and stating that he would not appeal. Sun had been a member of the partyís elite 25-member Politburo and the top official in the western megacity of Chongqing before suddenly being removed in July. He pleaded guilty to the charges in court and expressed repentance, according to Tianjinís No. 1 Intermediate Peopleís Court, which imposed his sentence less than one month after the trial opened in a relatively swift resolution of the case. In return for the bribes, Sun and his associates allegedly provided assistance to unspecified organizations and individuals with engineering contracts, business operations and other matters, the court said. Despite Sunís conviction on criminal charges, Chinese leaders and party-run media have made it clear that Sunís offenses were largely political in nature. At a party meeting last year, a senior official stated that Sun and other senior figures prosecuted in Xiís anti-corruption crackdown were ìconspiring openly to usurp party leadership.î Sun had been expelled from the party and dismissed from public office in September because he was suspected of ìserious discipline violations,î a phrase that usually refers to bribery but increasingly also includes political disloyalty. He was replaced in Chongqing by Xi protÈgÈ Chen Miníer, who was subsequently promoted to the Politburo. Sun had been identified most closely with the partyís China Youth League faction associated with Xiís predecessor, Hu Jintao, which Xi ó who also heads the ruling party ó has effectively sidelined in his consolidation of power. Xi in March saw through a constitutional amendment removing term limits on the presidency, setting himself up to remain head of state indefinitely."

Yet the team around him is not exactly reminiscent of the Showtime Lakers, or even the Cavaliers of a year ago. Besides, consider what the East will look like in the seasons to come. The Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are both ascendant teams, with young stars who will surely improve with age. The Indiana Pacers, who can build around Victor Oladipo, pushed the Cavaliers to seven games in the first round. Advertisement And the Cavaliers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> well, who knows? James will have a role in their future, for better or for worse. But the conference is on the rise. The Raptors are still capable of competing, of course. Kyle Lowry, 32, and DeRozan, 28, both have extensive long-term deals. It is uncertain, though, where the Raptors go from here. Casey used three different starting lineups in four games against the Cavaliers, which was difficult to interpret as anything other than a sign of exasperation, or desperation. He went so far as to bench DeRozan for the fourth quarter of Game 3, as the Raptors mounted a comeback without him, only to have James win the game for Cleveland with a skyscraping, single-legged floater as time expired. Casey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s job status was tenuous even before the start of Game 4, and so much of it was because of one man. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Everyone had counted Cleveland out, ‚<U+0080>ù Casey said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But as long as they have him, they have a chance.‚<U+0080>ù James finished the series with 136 points, 45 assists and 33 rebounds. DeRozan and Lowry combined for 138 points, 46 assists and 30 rebounds. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Last three years been rough for us, competing against this team, ‚<U+0080>ù DeRozan said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe they just got our number.‚<U+0080>ù DeRozan spoke with more than a trace of resignation, which was understandable. It is cruel what James has done to the Raptors, who have experienced various iterations of him over the years: Dominant LeBron, Playful LeBron, Clutch LeBron, Soul-Crushing LeBron. They saw all the LeBrons in this series. For the first half of Monday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s game, the Raptors were left in the swirling wake of Facilitating LeBron, a consummate teammate who created for everyone else. He looked to draw charges. He delivered behind-the-back rockets. He deflected passes out of bounds. Then came the third quarter, when James scored 15 of his 29 points to turn a halfway competitive game into a rout. He soon began looking ahead ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to another appearance in the conference finals, to the possibility of competing for another championship.

Rudolph Giuliani has struggled over the past week to clarify the Trump administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s official narrative in the Stormy Daniels scandal ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s turning him into the latest punching bag for late-night TV hosts. On Sunday, Giuliani walked back comments he made last week confirming that President Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen for the hush money Cohen had sent to Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Giuliani told George Stephanopolous of ABC that the facts he had outlined might actually be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>rumors.‚<U+0080>ù Trevor Noah cried foul, saying that the Trump White House can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t simply claim that unfavorable truths are rumors. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At this point, Giuliani‚<U+0080><U+0099>s defense strategy seems to be, dismantle reality.

Chief","The ongoing revelations of Mr. Pruittís ethical missteps may be making the president more receptive to Mr. Pruittís exit, according to officials.","Coral Davenport, Maggie Haberman",Climate,Domestic Politics,"US Politics, Lobbying, Scott Pruitt, EPA, Environment, Ethics Misconduct Malfeasance","WASHINGTON ó Senior White House staff members are encouraging President Trump to fire Scott Pruitt, his embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief, according to two top administration officials. While Mr. Trump has until now championed Mr. Pruitt, the officials say the presidentís enthusiasm may be cooling because of the ongoing cascade of alleged ethical and legal missteps. Over the past few months, as Mr. Pruittís problems have mounted ó he is now the subject of at least 11 federal investigations and some Republicans have called for his resignation ó Mr. Trump has continued to support his E.P.A. chief on Twitter and in public and private remarks. But that is likely to change in the coming weeks, the two officials said. Since last monthís confirmation of Mr. Pruittís deputy, the former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, White House staff members say they believe that if Mr. Pruitt is fired or resigns, Mr. Wheeler will continue to effectively push through Mr. Trumpís agenda to help the coal industry and roll back environmental regulations. Some Republicans have said that Mr. Wheeler, a former Capitol Hill and E.P.A. staff member ó known as a low-key but highly experienced Washington insider ó would quite likely be as effective, and possibly more so, than Mr. Pruitt at undoing regulations, without drawing the embarrassing headlines of his boss. At the White House on Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, expressed confidence in Mr. Wheeler but declined to say whether Mr. Trump intended to fire Mr. Pruitt in the near future. ìI donít have any personnel announcements on that front,î Ms. Sanders said. ìCertainly we have confidence in the No. 2, otherwise the president wouldnít have asked him to serve at such a senior level position within the E.P.A.î Meanwhile, as the negative media reports about Mr. Pruitt continue, Mr. Trump is now likely to pay more attention, the officials said. One official said there was recognition now that Mr. Pruittís problems were ìa bottomless pit.î But the White House doesnít know how much more there is or what direction it could take. Newly revealed emails detail how Mr. Pruitt operated the agency in unprecedented secrecy. Privately, even many in Mr. Pruittís inner circle at the E.P.A. have expressed frustration with their bossís actions. In the past month, at least five of his senior staff members have resigned, including Samantha Dravis, his senior policy adviser; Pasquale Perrotta, his chief of security; Albert Kelly, a business associate from Mr. Pruittís home state of Oklahoma whom Mr. Pruitt had appointed to a top policy position at the E.P.A.; Liz Bowman, his communications director; and John Konkus, a senior press office official. As many as a dozen more senior political staff members are said to be considering resigning, according to three current staff members and one former one. Mr. Pruittís actions have tried the patience of even his staunch supporters, including some Republicans. ìRepublicans like what heís done, but they donít like how heís done it,î said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who worked for the former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the former Majority Leader Tom DeLay. ìHe has made some major mistakes and doesnít seem to care that much about them. They have a lot of tolerance, but it has its limits.î Other administration officials have resigned over similar ethics and spending controversies. Tom Price, the former secretary of health and human services, was forced to resign last year after racking up nearly $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights. Mr. Trump fired David J. Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary, after an inspector generalís report concluded that he had spent too much time sightseeing on official trips and had improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift. Some of the 11 federal investigations into Mr. Pruittís behavior span a far wider range of ethics questions. The House Oversight Committee, led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, has opened an inquiry into Mr. Pruittís actions at the E.P.A., the first Republican-led investigation of a Trump administration cabinet member. On May 2, Mr. Gowdyís staff began conducting transcribed, closed-door interviews with Mr. Pruittís closest aides. A government watchdog office has concluded that Mr. Pruitt broke the law with the $43,000 installation of a secure telephone booth. He remains under investigation for several ethics concerns, including his condominium-rental agreement with the wife of an energy lobbyist, and the accusations that he demoted or sidelined E.P.A. employees who questioned his spending. He has been criticized for lavish expenditures on foreign travel, including a trip to Morocco ó a country where the E.P.A. has no policy agenda ó that was arranged by a lobbyist. His domestic travel also came under scrutiny after a former Pruitt staff member told Congressional investigators that Mr. Pruitt often sought to justify travel home to Oklahoma, directing his employees to ìfind me something to doî there. Still, Mr. Pruittís supporters, including some of Mr. Trumpís most prominent friends in the coal and oil industries, note that the E.P.A. administrator, perhaps more than any cabinet member, has pushed through a policy agenda that allows Mr. Trump to claim that he is fulfilling a core campaign promise: stripping away regulations that he says stymie the growth of the American economy. Some of those rollbacks have come at the direct request of Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of Murray Energy, one of the nationís largest coal producers, who is a longtime Trump supporter and donated $300,000 to the presidentís inauguration. ìAdministrator Pruitt has been the star of the Trump Administration,î Mr. Murray said in a statement. ìHe is taking the actions necessary to reverse the illegal and destructive regulations of the Obama Administration.î Harold Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma-based oil and gas company, who has advised Mr. Trump and championed Mr. Pruitt, has told people close to the White House that he continues to support the E.P.A. leader. During an April 26 appearance before a Congressional committee, at which Mr. Pruitt had been expected to come under fire for his alleged ethical lapses, conservative Republicans from farm and rust belt states lavishly praised Mr. Pruitt for his policy work. Representative Kevin Cramer of South Dakota, who advised the Trump campaign and is running for Senate, told Mr. Pruitt, ìI think the greatest sin that youíve committed, if any, is that you have actually done what President Trump ran on, what he won on, and what he has commissioned you to do in finding some balance in both carrying out the mission of environmental protection, while at the same time looking over economy and jobs creation.î"

It could also ignite the Middle East.",Roger Cohen,Opinion,Domestic Politics,"Nuclear weapon, Iran, Military, US Foreign Policy, US Politics, International Atomic Energy Agency, Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump, Mohammad Javad Zarif, John Bolton","President Trump is withdrawing the United States from an Iran nuclear deal that has worked, in the name of unrelated demands that are unworkable, at very high cost to Americaís alliances and the value of its word, with no viable alternative policy in place and at the risk of igniting the Middle East. Only Trump can believe that makes sense. But believe it he does, with a vengeance. From Day 1, it has been the deal Trump loves to hate. He knows who authorized it: Barack Obama. Whether he knows its content is another matter. The nuclear accord, reached in 2015, was a watershed. It was not intended to end Iranian-American enmity, virulent since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but it did dent dangerous confrontation through dialogue. It was a gamble on drawing Iran, a hopeful and highly educated society, closer to the world and so weakening the Islamic Republicís hard-liners. It was not about Iranian interference in neighboring Arab states or about its ballistic missile program. It concerned centrifuges and Iranís clear but never avowed quest for a nuclear bomb. The agreement put a ring fence around Iranís nuclear program into the second quarter of this century. It slashed centrifuges by two-thirds; virtually eliminated its uranium stockpile; capped enrichment levels at 3.7 percent, a long way from bomb grade; cut off a plutonium route to a bomb; and redoubled international inspection. On all this, Iran was in compliance, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its nuclear ambitions had been checked, a reason several Israeli military and intelligence officials, including former heads of Mossad and Shin Bet, backed the accord, along with former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. It was not ìa horrible, one-sided deal,î as Trump grotesquely claimed on Tuesday. It was not about delivering ìpeace,î as he absurdly suggested. It was not a ìrotten structure,î as he emptily claimed. It was a painful compromise where each side got less than it wanted: Iran a cash windfall, potential reintegration in the global economy and partial lifting of sanctions; the other signatories, including France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China, a bulwark against a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race. Thatís what diplomacy is about: imperfect solutions, arrived at between enemies, that are better than the alternatives, the worst of them all being war. Iran remains a repressive and disruptive regime, with a hideous human rights record, that has jailed several Americans since the deal, pursuing interests opposed to the United States in Syria, and underwriting Hezbollah. The nuclear deal was concluded in full knowledge of the Islamic Republicís character, perhaps with the hope of tempering Iranian behavior over time, but never with any illusion that Iran would suddenly reinvent itself. Yet this is what the Trump administration has demanded. America has made a mockery of the value of its signature on an international agreement. The world will take note. Nothing in Trumpís speech was more scurrilous than this very Orwellian inversion of the truth: ìIf I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.î In fact, Trump has single-handedly fast-forwarded that race by removing the constraints the deal imposed on Iran. What are the presidentís alternatives now? Prodded by his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump apparently believes he can bring Iran to its knees, perhaps even precipitate regime change, through new and restored sanctions. At the least he wants a broader, longer-term deal than the one heís ripping up. All thatís a pipe dream. Iran is not North Korea. Braggadocio will get Trump nowhere with a proud nation used to working around the cost of confrontation with the United States. The diplomatic unity of purpose that led Iran to acquiesce to the deal in 2015 is now frayed. European allies are angered, Russia and China certain to push their own agendas. Iranís economy is strained, and there are strong internal political tensions, but the 39-year-old Islamic Republic is resilient. Angered, it will not fold. In truth, Trump was led to this decision not by any serious calculus about the deal, but by his susceptibility to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi fury at Iran, the pressure of conservative American Jews who support him and his iron principle that whatever Obama did must be bad. He succumbed to Iran derangement syndrome, a well-known American condition. In an interview in Riyadh, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, told me the deal was bad from the outset, and ìWe want to make sure that there is something in place that prevents Iran from ever going nuclear.î He continued: ìWe want Iran to be a good neighbor. We want Iran to comply with international law. We want Iran to stop interfering in the affairs of Arab countries. We want Iran to stop supporting terrorists. We want Iran to stop harboring terrorists. We want Iran to stop attacking our embassies, to stop killing our diplomats. We want Iran to not give ballistic missiles to terrorist groups. Simple. Once they do it, itís a different Iran.î But nothing with Iran is simple. The question has always been: Do you change Iran by isolating it or by engaging it step by step? The nuclear deal was a possible starting point in engagement, and it had immense value in itself because it kept Iran much further from the bomb that would lead the Saudis and others to go the same route. Now all that has been thrown up in the air by Trump. Through an act of utter petulance, he has done a grave disservice to American interests and alliances. I saw Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, in New York last month. He said the deal ó ìa conscious decision not to deal with everythingî ó could have been ìthe beginning of a new type of engagement.î Instead, Iran may now restart those centrifuges and race for a bomb. Perhaps something can be salvaged by European powers. I doubt it. Trump has done what he likes to do: express his anger, break things and hope for the best. His Iran decision is a reckless gamble, even by his standards, the shredding of a singular diplomatic achievement."

Itís vandalism. Trump is abandoning the Iran deal, with nothing to replace it, even though his own secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff say that Iran appears to be in compliance; even though his own secretary of defense says that staying in the deal is in Americaís interest; even though our allies are pleading to stick with it. The reason for Trumpís decision seems obvious: The deal was President Barack Obamaís. This petty retreat from diplomacy is the most significant national security move Trump has made. It means that Trump is isolating the United States, not Iran, and it increases the risk of military conflict down the road. If thereís anything we should have learned, itís to avoid unnecessary wars in the Middle East ó but Trump may be laying the groundwork for yet another. ìMany regard the invasion of Iraq as the worst foreign policy move in the history of the American republic,î James Dobbins, a much respected retired diplomat, tweeted after Trumpís speech. ìNow we have a competitor.î The Iranian nuclear deal may not permanently solve the problem of Iranís pursuit of nuclear weapons, but it delays any crisis for nearly 15 years or more. Trump doesnít want to risk a possible crisis then, so he chooses to have one now ó apparently, just for the satisfaction of kicking sand at Obama. A crisis wonít necessarily result right away. It could be some months before sanctions would actually kick in, and in any case Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said this week that the nuclear deal could remain in place even if the Americans pull out. Rather, Iran may try for moderation to peel European allies away from America ó and Trump is playing into this Iranian strategy. Some in the international community will regard the actions of President Trump and of Iranís supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and see Khamenei as more of a statesman. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to be itching for a joint American-Israeli strike on Iran. Netanyahu may see political advantages to a triumphant air strike, and I fear Trump might as well. Trump may have absorbed the unfortunate lesson from his military strikes on Syria that when he fires missiles, he is hailed as presidential. Iím told that the United States years ago secretly built a replica of the Iranian complex at Fordo, which is deep underground to protect it from bombings, and practiced striking it with new munitions to see whether it could be destroyed. Based on those tests, America could indeed destroy Fordo ó and that will give hawks in the Trump administration, like John Bolton, more confidence as they advocate military options down the road. Bolton is smart and knowledgeable, but his hawkish approach also has a track record. Letís see how it did in three cases: First, Bolton agitated for the Iraq war and still considers the invasion to have been a wise decision. The war, remember, killed 4,500 Americans, about half a million Iraqis, and cost the U.S. some $3 trillion ó or $24,000 per American household. Second, Bolton in 2002 helped kill the Agreed Framework that had kept North Korea from building a single nuclear warhead during the Clinton years. North Korea was secretly evading the framework, so tough negotiation was required ó but instead Bolton helped blow up the deal, and since then North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests and developed intercontinental missiles that can reach the U.S. Third, Bolton in 2003 and 2004 helped end a European initiative to reach a deal with Iran on nuclear issues at that time, when the program was in much earlier stages. In each of these cases, Bolton and the hawks were right that diplomacy was a flawed tool and might not have achieved our objectives: In international relations, there are more problems than solutions. What is clear is that the hawkish non-diplomatic paths failed catastrophically. A basic problem with military options is that, as the Prussian strategist Helmuth Von Moltke observed, no military plan survives first contact with the enemy. After a strike, Iran might try to blow up Saudi oil installations, or block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, or it could use its proxies in Lebanon to stir up a war with Israel. Iíve reported in Iran (and been detained there by secret police and accused of spying), and I know full well that the regime is untrustworthy. Thatís precisely the reason for the nuclear deal and the rigorous inspections that come with it. For now, the inspectors agree that Iran is essentially in compliance ó while the U.S. arguably violated it by failing to approve licenses for commerce with Iran, and by subverting normal trade relations. So why destroy a deal that is working, other than to dismantle some of Obamaís legacy? ìWhatís the purpose of all this?î asks Jake Sullivan, a former senior State Department official involved in the outreach to Iran. ìYou put pressure back on, and whatís the purpose? Is it to achieve a new nuclear deal? Is it about regime change?î Sullivan noted that thereís little chance of Trump actually negotiating a new deal, and added: ìSo whatís the point of this other than ëIranians are bad people and weíre going to hurt them.í Whatís the strategy other than a temper tantrum?î And thatís why I see Trumpís move as less about foreign policy than about vandalism."

Sanger,Politics,Domestic Politics,NA,"WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> For President Trump and two of the allies he values most ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Israel and Saudi Arabia ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized the clerical Iranian government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, and support of terror groups. Now, with his pending announcement this afternoon that he will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and terminate America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment to the Obama-era deal, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment. As one senior European official said, Mr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s economic lifeline and thus ‚<U+0080><U+009C>break the regime‚<U+0080>ù by dismantling the deal. In theory, that could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants ‚<U+0080><U+0094> what it was doing five years ago, when the world feared it was headed toward a bomb. But Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s team dismisses that risk: Tehran doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and the Saudis. And Iran knows that any move toward ‚<U+0080><U+009C>breakout‚<U+0080>ù to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action. Advertisement It is a brutally realpolitik approach that America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war. Whether that proves to be accurate or overwrought, it is clearly an example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015 between John Kerry, then the secretary of state, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran. Mr. Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gamble in that deal ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was straightforward. He regarded Iran as a potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy. By taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry had argued, the two countries could over time chip away at three decades of hostility, and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State. It didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nuclear material out of the country, Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West. Months before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military boosted its support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terror groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyber attacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord. Then came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>disaster‚<U+0080>ù and his vow to blow it up. Now, suddenly, the world appears headed back to where it was in 2012: On a road to uncertain confrontation, with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>very little evidence of a Plan B, ‚<U+0080>ù as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit here. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Exiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a problem that the Saudis believe will be solved only by regime change in Iran. They have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new national security adviser, who shares that view. Advertisement Israel is a more complicated case. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that he has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu‚<U+0080><U+0099>s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon. As a last-minute lure to convince Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal, Mr. Netanyahu last week released Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, that proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead. To Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy. Given evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested Iran has not given up its ambitions. As former Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And, given the danger that Iran would have the ability to move rapidly to a weapon in the year 2030, ‚<U+0080>ù when the limits on enrichment are removed, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the sunset issue needs to be addressed, ‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Ross, who was part of the Obama administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first term, before the negotiations on the Iran deal began to take shape. At the core of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb. When the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to blow up the entire deal. It would be a very Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weaken a regime Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go."

The United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord ó and impose additional economic penalties as well, the person said. A second person familiar with negotiations to keep the 2015 accord in place said the talks collapsed over Mr. Trumpís insistence that sharp limits be kept on Iranís nuclear fuel production after 2030. The deal currently lifts those limits. Mr. Trump is planning to formally announce his decision at 2 p.m. on Tuesday at the White House. Mr. Trumpís decision, while long anticipated and widely telegraphed, plunges Americaís relations with European allies into deep uncertainty. They have committed to staying in the deal, raising the prospect of a diplomatic and economic clash as the United States reimposes stringent sanctions on Iran. It also raises the prospect of increased tensions with Russia and China, which also are parties to the agreement. The decision fulfills one of Mr. Trumpís oft-repeated campaign promises, and came despite intense personal lobbying by European leaders and frantic attempts to craft fixes to the deal that would satisfy him. The presidentís own aides had persuaded him twice last year not to take this step. But Mr. Trump made clear that his patience with the deal had worn thin, and with a new, more hawkish set of advisers ó led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton ó Mr. Trump faced less internal resistance this time."

The administration is planning to impose additional economic penalties as well. The decision unravels the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, and isolates the United States from its European allies. [Read our main article on Mr. Trumpís decision.] The following is a transcript of his announcement, delivered from the Diplomatic Room of the White House. ________ PRESIDENT TRUMP: My fellow Americans, Today, I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror. It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Over the years, Iran and its proxies have bombed American Embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American service members, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens. The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people. No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons ó and the means of delivering them. In 2015, the previous administration joined with other nations in a deal regarding Iranís nuclear program. This agreement was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A. In theory, the so-called ìIran dealî was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime. In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and ó over time ó reach the brink of a nuclear breakout. The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regimeís nuclear activity ó and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world. In other words, at the point when the United States had maximum leverage, this disastrous deal gave this regime ó and itís a regime of great terror ó many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash ó a great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States. A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it wasnít. At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction: that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program. Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Last week, Israel published intelligence documents ó long concealed by Iran ó conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons. The fact is, this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didnít bring calm, it didnít bring peace, and it never will. In the years since the deal was reached, Iranís military budget has grown by almost 40 percent ó while its economy is doing very badly. After the sanctions were lifted, the dictatorship used its new funds to build its nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism, and cause havoc throughout the Middle East and beyond. The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time. The dealís sunset provisions are totally unacceptable. If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs. Making matters worse, the dealís inspection provisions lack adequate mechanisms to prevent, detect, and punish cheating and donít even have the unqualified right to inspect many important locations, including military facilities. Not only does the deal fail to halt Iranís nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regimeís development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads. Finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iranís destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism. Since the agreement, Iranís bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen. In light of these glaring flaws, I announced last October that the Iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated. Three months later, on January 12th, I repeated these conditions. I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement. Over the past few months, we have engaged extensively with our allies and partners around the world, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We have also consulted with our friends from across the Middle East. We are unified in our understanding of the threat and in our conviction that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon. After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement. The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the worldís leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the worldís most dangerous weapons. Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States. America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. And we will not allow a regime that chants ìDeath to Americaî to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth. Todayís action sends a critical message. The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them. In fact, at this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. Plans are being made, relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen, and with the help of China, South Korea, and Japan, a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone. As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat. This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iranís ballistic missile program, to stop its terrorist activities worldwide, and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East. In the meantime, powerful sanction also go into full effect. If the regime continues its its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before. Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran. The people of America stand with you. It has now been almost 40 years since this dictatorship seized power and took a proud nation hostage. Most of Iranís 80 million citizens have sadly never known an Iran that prospered in peace with its neighbors and commanded the admiration of the world. But the future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land, and they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history and glory to God. Iranís leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal. They refuse, and thatís fine. Iíd probably say the same thing if I was in their position. But the fact is, they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. When they do, I am ready, willing, and able. Great things can happen for Iran. And great things can happen for the peace and stability that we all want in the Middle East. There has been enough suffering, death, and destruction. Let it end now. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. REPORTER: Mr. President, how does this make America safer? How does this make America safer? TRUMP: Thank you very much. This will make America much safer. Thank you very much. REPORTER: Is Secretary Pompeo bringing the detainees home? TRUMP: Secretary Pompeo is right now going to North Korea. He will be there very shortly, in a matter of virtual ó probably an hour. Heís got meetings set up. We have our meeting scheduled. We have our meeting set. The location is picked. The time and date. Everything is picked. And we look forward to having a very great success. We think relationships are building with North Korea. Weíll see how it all works out. Maybe it will. Maybe it wonít. But it can be a great thing for North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the entire world. We hope it all works out. Thank you very much. REPORTER: Are the Americans being freed? TRUMP: Weíll all soon be finding out. We will soon be finding out. It would be a great thing if they are. Weíll soon be finding out. Thank you very much."
141,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:07,19:44:10,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/uber-crash-autonomous-driveai.html,"After Fatal Uber Crash, a Self-Driving Start-Up Moves Forward",Drive.ai said it would start a taxi service in Texas. It was the first new rollout of autonomous cars in the United States since one operated by Uber killed a pedestrian in March.,Cade Metz,Technology,Technology,"Driverless Cars;Self-Driving Cars, Car Crash, Taxis, Car Service, Venture capital, Startup, Artificial intelligence, Drive.ai, Uber, Andrew Y Ng, Frisco","FRISCO, Tex. ó On Monday, an orange and blue car with the words ìSelf-Driving Vehicleî prominently displayed on both sides drove itself through the streets of this rapidly growing city north of Dallas, navigating across four lanes of traffic and around a traffic circle. The car, operated by the Silicon Valley start-up Drive.ai, will eventually become part of a fleet of autonomous taxis that will ferry locals along a predetermined route between the Dallas Cowboys facility in Frisco and two other office, retail and apartment complexes. While other companies have tested self-driving cars for years and some are in the early stages of offering a taxi service, Drive.aiís autonomous vehicle debut on Monday was still notable. It was the first new rollout of autonomous cars in the United States since a pedestrian died in Arizona in March after a self-driving car operated by Uber hit her. The fatal crash renewed a debate about driverless technology safety, casting a chill over the industry. Uber immediately halted its testing program, which remains at a standstill. Other big players, including Toyota, also paused their self-driving tests. But Drive.aiís announcement that it will officially begin its taxi service in July showed that the industry is starting to get back on track. ìYou donít succeed by staring in the rearview mirror,î said Andrew Ng, a board member of Drive.ai, who helped found the artificial intelligence labs at Google and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. Drive.ai said it was moving ahead even as questions about the cause of Uberís crash remained unanswered. Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, declined to comment on specifics, citing an continuing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. But she said the company had initiated a ìtop-to-bottom safety reviewî and had brought on Christopher A. Hart, a former chairman of the safety board, as an adviser on its ìoverall safety culture.î Tarin Ziyaee, until recently the chief technology officer of the self-driving start-up Voyage, said he hoped the Uber crash would push companies to openly discuss the powerful but still limited technologies inside their test cars. ìWe need to talk about the nitty-gritty ó what these systems are really doing and where their weaknesses are,î said Mr. Ziyaee, who also worked on autonomous systems at Apple. ìThese companies are putting secrecy over safety. That has to change. The public deserves to know how things work.î Mr. Ng said the Uber crash had not affected Drive.aiís rollout plans. ìWeíre focused on the path forward,î he said. Drive.ai was founded in 2015 by Mr. Ngís wife, Carol Reiley, a roboticist, and several students who worked in a Stanford University A.I. lab overseen by Mr. Ng. The start-up specializes in a rapidly progressing type of artificial intelligence called deep learning, which allows systems to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Venture capital firms including New Enterprise Associates have since invested in the start-up. Based in Mountain View, Calif., Drive.ai has raised $77 million and has more than 100 employees. Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company that was spun out of Google, is already running a private taxi service outside Phoenix, in a state that is a popular destination for self-driving car experiments. Drive.ai chose to begin its trials in Frisco, where the streets are clean and wide, pedestrian traffic is light and the sun is out for 230 days a year, on average. A Texas law passed in the fall also lets companies operate self-driving services with no restrictions from municipal governments. When Drive.aiís free, daytime-only service begins this summer, it will be open to 10,000 people who live or work in the area. The cars will travel along a few miles of road where the speed limit does not exceed 45 miles an hour, with passengers being picked up and dropped off at only a few specific locations. Backup drivers will be behind the wheel, taking control when needed. But as the program expands, Drive.ai plans on moving drivers into the passenger seat and out of the cars entirely by the end of the year. Though pedestrians are scarce in the area, the cars will drive through parking lots where they are likely to encounter foot traffic. So Drive.ai equipped its cars with digital displays designed to communicate with pedestrians and other drivers. While an autonomous vehicle cannot make eye contact with a pedestrian or respond to hand signals, it can display a simple message like ìWaiting for you to crossî or ìPicking up.î Because the cars are equipped with sensors that gather information about their surroundings by sending out pulses of light ó as well as radar and an array of cameras ó the cars could potentially operate at night as well. But the start-up decided to keep a tight rein on its service before gradually expanding the route and exposing the cars to new conditions. Drive.ai said it would suspend operations during a downpour and in the rare event of snow. There will still be situations where the cars are slow to make decisions on their own ó in the face of extremely heavy traffic, for instance ó but remote technicians employed by Drive.ai will send help to the cars over the internet. The cars will include connections to three separate cellular networks. Drive.ai said it was working closely with Frisco officials. The city of 175,000 can keep the company abreast of construction zones and other road changes, Mr. Ng said, and signs identifying the area where the cars will drive have been installed. Thomas Bamonte, a senior program manager for automated vehicles with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, which handles planning for Dallas and surrounding areas, said such work would become increasingly important as the metropolitan area added roughly a million new people every 10 years. ìWe want to invest in new technology rather than the physical expansion of roadways,î he said. Asked if the Uber crash gave him pause, he said state law allowed companies like Drive.ai to operate without interference from local governments. The companies, he said, must be cautious. Noah Marshall, a financial analyst with Jamba Juice, which is based in Frisco, said the new autonomous taxi service would be a ìgreat thingî for the town. His office is along Drive.aiís route, and he said he hoped to try the service. Other Frisco residents were warier. ìThis might be a good idea, but there is so much traffic here, and Texans arenít very patient,î said Mark Mulch, a local real estate agent. Referring to one Arizona city where self-driving cars are being tested, he added: ìScottsdale is laid back. But Dallas is too fast.î"

Moderate Candidates Still Tend to Outdo Extreme Ones,Research points to a key to political victories in the House: Donít nominate someone who will motivate the other side to show up.,Lynn Vavreck,The Upshot,Domestic Politics,"US Politics, Primaries, Voting, House races","Donald J. Trumpís rise to the G.O.P. nomination and eventual presidential victory gave heft to the idea that extreme candidates can beat moderates by galvanizing their partyís base. That premise is shaping competitive races in both parties. But an analysis of more than 30 years of House general elections suggests the opposite. It seems that when parties nominate an extreme candidate ó in a district where a more moderate candidate might have had a chance to win the primary ó the extreme candidate does worse in the general election. Extreme candidates fire up voters, but not always in the way the candidates would like. A party that nominates an extreme candidate when it could have nominated a more moderate one may lose as much as seven points of vote share in the general election, according to Andrew Hall, a political scientist at Stanford University, and Daniel Thompson, a doctoral student there. Seven points would have been enough to swing dozens of House races in 2016 alone. Extreme candidates, the researchers say, may mobilize their partyís base ó but they tend to activate their opponentís base even more than their own, resulting in a net loss on turnout. They also seem to lose habitual voters ó the people who almost always turn out to vote ó to the opposition party, while moderate nominees hold on to those voters. In this way, extreme nominees lose votes in two ways: mobilization and persuasion. The findings initially seem counterintuitive because Congress has become more separated by ideology and party than ever. So it seems as if extreme candidates must be winning general elections more often than moderates. But as Mr. Hall points out, both patterns can be true. Extreme candidates may be less likely to win general elections than more moderate ones, but if the supply of candidates over all is becoming more ideologically extreme, the average ideological divide in Congress could be increasing. Mr. Hall and Mr. Thompson had to overcome significant measurement and research challenges to illustrate these patterns. They had to find a way to characterize the ideologies of candidates who were running in primaries (most of whom had no political records before running). And they had to find a way to hold everything in a district constant except whether a party nominated a moderate or extreme candidate in a place where both were equally likely to win the primary. To overcome the first challenge, the researchers developed a donation-based method of characterizing candidatesí ideologies (similar to work done by Adam Bonica, also from Stanford). The measure assumes that candidates who receive contributions from the same donors and groups are ideologically similar. To overcome the second hurdle, they focused on close primary races between a more moderate and an extreme candidate between 2006 and 2014. Because the researchers focus on close outcomes, they know that both candidates were viable choices for that party in that district. In these races, the final count was so close as to be nearly decided by luck, as in a coin flip. Between 2006 and 2014, about 125 races fell into this category. This technique is important to the researcherís approach. Itís as if the victory by the extreme candidate over the moderate one were a randomized experiment. If there are differences in the vote share or turnout patterns of the general election races in these districts ó which are nearly the same in every way other than which candidate won the party primary ó they are attributed to the nomineesí characteristics, including their ideology. Essentially, these quasi-natural experiments allow the researchers to isolate the effect of the candidateís ideology and compare the general election outcomes across districts that got one type of candidate (nearly by chance) with districts that got the other. Using a variety of methods, Mr. Hall and Mr. Thompson estimate that in these 125 close elections, a party that chooses the more extreme nominee in the primary sees roughly a six-point drop in the number of its registered voters who show up at the polls in November. Itís a drop-off that does not exist when the party nominates a more moderate candidate. The notion that turnout drives midterm elections is not new, nor is the idea that ideologies of members of Congress can affect vote share, nor that competition may have a moderating influence on candidates. A rich body of work in political science examines these ideas from different angles. But few have explicitly tried to highlight the role candidatesí ideologies play in affecting turnout. Itís an important niche, especially in todayís polarized climate as party leaders may be tempted to give primary voters ìwhat they want,î ignoring what general election voters may prefer. It is worth noting that many other things affect turnout in elections, including the other races on the ballot and electioneering efforts by all the candidates and groups with a stake in an outcome. But the takeaway for parties is that even if they nominate the more extreme candidate and he or she wins the general election in November ó it is likely the party could have done even better in that race by nominating a viable candidate who was more moderate. Voters may be more emotionally wedded to their party than ever before, but party strategists would be foolish to think this means voters will always show up on Election Day or that the share of swing voters in the electorate donít care how extreme a nominee may be. Mr. Hall and Mr. Thompson have shown political parties one way to avoid losing votes: Keep an eye on how likely your nominee is to motivate the other side to show up and nominate accordingly.

Music, this 29-year-old modern-day Renaissance man isnít your average hip-hop artist.",Joe Coscarelli,Arts,Entertainment,"Rap and Hip-Hop,, Kanye West, Def Jam,","Earlier this year, on the set of his first major music video, the rapper Valee was hemming his own clothes. The shoot for ìMiami,î featuring the hip-hop godfather Pusha T, who doubles as the president of Kanye Westís G.O.O.D. Music, was meant to announce Valee, a 29-year-old from Chicago, as the latest addition to the tastemaking label. But instead of acting like a newly minted star, leaning into a world of stylists and on-demand everything, he brought a sewing machine from home. ìI put stuff together,î Valee said with a shrug during a recent trip to New York. It was an understatement, but also an all-purpose job description, one that hinted at the motivations of a man who is less a born rapper than a detail-obsessed D.I.Y. aesthete, always looking for a fresh creative angle. While honing his music, which he often self-produces and records at home, Valee has turned odd hobbies into odd jobs, toeing the line between eccentric and modern-day Renaissance man. He does carpentry, construction and electrical work, and builds koi ponds, too. He customizes fast cars ó full-size and remote control ó and cooks. Heís tattooed others, as well as his own arms and legs. ìI talk to a lot of rappers and people in the industry,î said Andrew Barber, Valeeís manager and an influential fixture in Chicago rap music. ìNobody else has ever offered to come build a bar in my house.î Valee, obviously, is not your typical rapper. At a time when lines have blurred between viral jester and professional musician, especially in hip-hop, and a new generation of stars have come to prominence via extracurricular antics (and, sometimes, heinous crimes), Valee is a low-key anomaly. He has only a perfunctory social media presence, no scandals or performative beefs to his name and, as a bit of a loner, comes unaffiliated with any existing movements or microgenres. At nearly 30, with two children and three dogs (Furrari, Ravioli and Sophia), he is basically ancient among those to spawn from YouTube and SoundCloud. ìAll these people that go extremely viral, I canít name you one damn song theyíve made,î Valee said, in reference to his disruptive contemporaries like 6ix9ine and XXXTentacion. ìYou just know them through being silly.î [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] ìIím real easygoing,î he added. ìI donít look at the view counts, I donít look at the comments ó itís a distraction. I would just rather be busy waiting on the next beat, so I can say something better than I just said.î That head-down, music-first work ethic has paid off gradually. Valeeís first commercial project, the ìGOOD Job, You Found Meî EP, was released in March and executive produced by Mr. West, who before his recent theatrics, brought Valee into the G.O.O.D. fold. ìI just felt proud of being able to tell my mom that íYe reached out,î Valee said, adding, ìHe saw that I built on my own with a small team.î In keeping with the times, Valee has continued to release a steady stream of new songs and distinct, minimalist music videos as he builds toward a body of work worthy of a proper debut album. ìI have probably 250 songs in the chest,î he said, ìbut I want to increase the quality.î Valee had been quietly releasing music online for a few years, developing a taste for murky, mid-tempo beats with blown-out bass, before he found a plugged-in booster in Mr. Barber early last year. The proprietor of the blog Fake Shore Drive, an early megaphone for breakout Chicago acts for the last decade, Mr. Barber was initially struck by Valeeís video for ìShell,î which, at one minute and 49 seconds, said it all. ìHe had a fully formed thing,î Mr. Barber said. ìIt wasnít something that you hear in this era, but it sounded current. And he just looked cool as hell.î And while Chicagoís musical reputation has bifurcated into the hyperaggressive drill sound popularized by Chief Keef and G Herbo or the theatrical positivity of Chance the Rapper and his acolytes, Valee was neither. Yet he ìwas being embraced by both scenes,î Mr. Barber said ó as likely to be played at a downtown hipster club or a strip club on the far South Side. Nonchalant on a track, in a way that indicates casual mastery, not laziness, Valee might mumble in tight, clipped flashes of melody or unleash a tumble of sly tongue twisters, as on his budding cult favorite ìTwo 16ís.î (As one Twitter user memorably put it, ìvalee raps like an old-timey tiptoeing burglar.î) Though his songs only sometimes clear two minutes ó ìThereís so many choices,î Valee said, referring to the streaming economy, ìso youíve got to put peopleís favorite part in that little amount of timeî ó his vivid writing in impressionistic bursts keeps standard fare (cars, clothes, women, guns) sounding fresh and often hilariously specific. ìSpent $1,200 on a Yorkie,î he raps, ìfed it Benihanaís food.î Elsewhere, an airport salad functions as a hiding place for marijuana and a custom vehicle (ìSuper Sport with frog eyesî) winds up ìdouble-parked at Five Guys.î Paul Rosenberg, the new chief executive at Def Jam, which oversees G.O.O.D., and Eminemís longtime manager, called Valee ìan authentic and infectious standout,î citing ìhis immediately recognizable voice and melodic cadences.î The rapper, he said, is ìexactly the type of artist we are excited to help build a fan base and career with.î Valee, tortoise-like, said he is chasing stability. Still, one of the downsides of not jumping up and down for attention in an oversaturated field is that, well, sometimes you donít get attention. While the Lil Pumps of the world are clocking nine-digit view counts on YouTube, Valee has yet to hit a million with a music video. ìI feel like Iím still developing,î he said, invoking his constant ìweíre-not-there-yet-type feeling.î In what might be seen as a market concession, the recent Valee video for ìSkinnyî was directed by Cole Bennett, the Hype Williams of the SoundCloud boom. Mr. Barber said that a big part of his job was to get Valee to come ìout of his shell and be a celebrity.î Backstage at a private show for New York University students, Valeeís D.J. and producer Rio Mac got in on the cheerleading, too, urging his friend to hype up the college crowd. ìI want you to stick your chest out,î he said. ìYouíre like a sex icon.î Valee demurred. ìIím an old man,î he said. ìA big weekend for me is Home Depot and a Caesar salad.î Earlier, touring the vintage seven-figure merchandise at Cooper Classic Cars in the West Village, he was similarly fixated on the little things, earning affection from the shop owner for his appreciation of obscure details and his poetic longings. Referring to the new, ground-level warehouse apartment he has been building for himself, Valee said wistfully, ìIíve always wanted to pull my classic car up directly to my kitchen, get out and leave the groceries right there.î But press him long enough, and he will admit to less elegant ambitions, as well. ìI want chart-topping records ó all of that,î Valee said, leaving the luxury cars as his friend played the breakout hit ìLook Alive,î by Blocboy JB, featuring Drake. ìI would love to one day have 100 million views on something. ìWhatís the song, whatís the beat? I donít know,î he added. ìBut I canít wait.î"

Mr. Orban‚<U+0080><U+0099>s party, Fidesz, and the allied Christian Democratic People‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Party won 133 of the 199 seats in Parliamentary after a campaign that election observers called free but not entirely fair. They relied heavily on xenophobic rhetoric, and appeared to unfairly harness state resources, according to observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The majority is large enough to vote through changes to Hungary‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Constitution, a power Mr. Orban last held in 2015. Since entering office for the second time in 2010, Mr. Orban has become a hero to the global far right for his nativist policies and for his efforts to mold Hungary into what he describes as an illiberal state. Advertisement Here is a selection of recent in-depth New York Times articles about his time in office. Over the past eight years, Mr. Orban has undermined many of the institutional checks and balances that liberal democracies depend on, installing loyalists at most state watchdogs and tweaking the election system to favor Fidesz. His appointees now control the judiciary, the Constitutional Court, the prosecution service, the electoral authority and the central bank. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. In parallel, Mr. Orban has tightened his grip over Hungarian culture ‚<U+0080><U+0094> targeting its artistic sphere, civil society and education system. He has sought to penalize rights groups, particularly those backed by the Hungarian-American philanthropist and financier George Soros. His narratives dominate state media and parts of the national curriculum, and his allies control most private media outlets and many universities and cultural institutions. Mr. Orban began his political life in the late 1980s as a liberal dissident, a friend to civil society, and an academic whose research was funded by Mr. Soros. In the three decades since, he drifted first to the center ground, then to the center right, and finally to the far right, as he sought power above ideological consistency. Mr. Orban remains popular with many Hungarians ‚<U+0080><U+0094> partly because of how the economy has performed under his leadership. Wages have risen more than 10 percent while unemployment ‚<U+0080><U+0094> according to the official statistics ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has fallen nearly two-thirds. But employment economists have questioned claims of an economic miracle, since the figures include Hungarians who have found work abroad, or in government-run schemes that pay less than the minimum wage. Mr. Orban did not release a manifesto during the campaign, but he did promise to seek ‚<U+0080><U+009C>moral, political and legal amends‚<U+0080>ù against his critics. That could include rights groups that work with migrants, who would face sanctions under draft legislation known as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stop Soros‚<U+0080>ù package. And it has already included a panel of critical judges, many of whom resigned under pressure from allies of the newly emboldened administration."

And in his efforts to help the shooting victims, he set what turned out to be a modest fund-raising goal: $15,000. Just two weeks later, though, Mr. Shawís GoFundMe has raised more than 15 times that amount ó about $227,000 as of Monday night. ìI am overwhelmed,î Mr. Shaw said in a statement. ìTo the thousands of people who have expressed their care, prayers and made financial donations, I can only respond by saying ëThank you.íî The widespread generosity, he added, ìhas been a heartwarming reminder of what is possible when we come together to care for one another.î Despite his best efforts, Mr. Shaw, 29, has been lionized for his decisive action in the wee hours of April 22. That morning, a gunman, identified by the police as Travis Reinking, opened fire at the Waffle House, fatally shooting four people and wounding several others, including Mr. Shaw. Mr. Shaw, an electrician, had seen a young man move toward the building gripping an AR-15 rifle and squeezing the trigger repeatedly. And when the firing paused, Mr. Shaw, who had just been seated, saw a chance to intervene while the man reloaded his weapon. Mr. Shaw scuffled with Mr. Reinking, seized his rifle and hurled it over a countertop, forcing Mr. Reinking to flee the restaurant. ìI just wanted to live,î Mr. Shaw later explained to The New York Times. Officials said later there would have been greater bloodshed had Mr. Shaw not acted. And the plaudits have poured in over the days since the shooting. State legislators, the Nashville Predators and even a minor-league baseball team have honored Mr. Shaw in some form or fashion. On Monday night, Mr. Shawís alma mater, Tennessee State University, recognized him at a ceremony and reception. A university spokesman said Tennessee State had also set up a scholarship in Mr. Shawís name. ìThe TSU family is extremely proud,î the universityís president, Glenda Glover, said in a statement. ìJames epitomizes the core values and mission of our institution.î In the meantime, Mr. Shawís fund-raiser has continued chugging along. The news release distributed Monday said the GoFundMe campaign would close on Sunday. It noted that the Nashville office of the wealth manager UBS would coordinate donations to victims and their families free of charge. Among the shooting victims was 21-year-old DeEbony Groves, a college senior who had been two weeks away from graduating from Belmont University in Nashville. The university has renamed a scholarship in her honor; over the weekend, Ms. Grovesí mother walked across the stage to accept her daughterís diploma. [Read our profile of the Waffle House shooting victims.] Mr. Reinking, 29, was captured after a massive manhunt that lasted more than a day. He is facing multiple charges, including four counts of criminal homicide and four counts of attempted criminal homicide, The Associated Press reported. The A.P. also said that Mr. Reinkingís public defender, on Monday, asked that he be given an outpatient mental health evaluation before proceeding with his court case. A judge granted the request and said lawyers should return in three weeks for a status hearing, the A.P. said."

But 5,000 miles from West Virginia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s capital city, in a suburb northwest of Moscow, someone was already scouting for ways to get into the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s election computer network this spring. That someone‚<U+0080><U+0099>s IP address, a designation as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>malicious host, ‚<U+0080>ù even a tiny Russian flag ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it was all there on a computer display in an office just across the Kanawha River from the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gold-domed capitol.

Since 2016, when Russian hackers attacked election systems in 21 states and even penetrated one voter-registration database, it has become clear that any election that relies on computers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that is, all of them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is a potential target for meddlers. Advertisement But the odds that the state will be able to fend off the attackers, or detect and correct any damage they do, are far better today than they were two years ago. West Virginia is neither wealthy nor particularly tech-savvy, but since 2016 it has embraced election cybersecurity with an enthusiasm that many other states have yet to muster. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We had a lot of county clerks saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Why are you talking so much about cybersecurity? The Russians aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t going to attack us, ‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief election official, Secretary of State Mac Warner, said in an interview. But in an era when election irregularities can be instantly publicized and spread online, he said, any state that does not protect its election systems is inviting an attack. While meddling by hostile nations is of greatest concern, hundreds and even thousands of other outsiders probe West Virginia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s election computer security almost daily, as they do in other states. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s usually difficult to tell whether a specific probe comes from a government, a live hacker intent on doing harm, or a computer program that is automatically checking for vulnerabilities. Mr. Warner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s point was driven home only last month when the elections website in Knox County, Tenn. was immobilized by a so-called distributed denial-of-service attack as the polls closed for a primary election. The attack, which was came from computers both inside and outside the country, slowed the reporting of election returns but did not destroy any data. Mr. Warner, a Republican in his first term as secretary of state, says he has taken the security threat to heart. Last year he sought and received an F.B.I. briefing on the origin and nature of the Russian cyberattacks, and he took a seat on a council of state, local and federal officials that coordinates election-security policies with the Department of Homeland Security. He has since obtained a security clearance that gives him limited access to intelligence on election-related threats. And he has placed the National Guard sergeant, who has a top-secret clearance, in West Virginia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Intelligence Fusion Center, a nexus of state and federal law-enforcement and intelligence officials who handle threats ranging from floods to cyberattacks. Nationwide, experts say, election security still can be a hit-or-miss affair. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, 13 states employ at least some voting machines that leave no paper record of ballots cast, making it impossible to detect fraud. Five of them use paperless machines exclusively. Georgia and Pennsylvania are particularly notorious for relying on voting devices that run ancient, insecure versions of Windows software and create no paper trail that can be audited. When the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress graded the states and the District of Columbia in February on seven key aspects of election security, no state earned higher than a B. Five ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas and Tennessee ‚<U+0080><U+0094> earned Fs. Advertisement But that is rapidly changing. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>While we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re certainly not all the way there, both awareness and activity in the security field is considerable‚<U+0080>ù among state election officials, said Doug Chapin, the director of the Program for Excellence in Election Administration at the University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe we haven‚<U+0080><U+0099>t closed all the holes. But we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re in the process of closing the bigger ones.‚<U+0080>ù States are making progress in replacing outdated paperless voting machines with new, more secure ones that leave a paper trail: Louisiana and Delaware, two of the five states, have sought bids for replacements, and Pennsylvania, the state with the largest number of paperless devices, told its 67 counties last month to order new machines to take their place by the end of 2019. Efforts to replace all voting machines in another paperless state, Georgia, died when the legislature adjourned in March. Bipartisan federal legislation that would enable states to receive federal grants to improve election cybersecurity is stalled in the Senate, apparently by Republican opposition; a similar Republican-sponsored bill in the House also appears dead in the water. Many election-security experts say the biggest threat is the one that Russian hackers seemed to focus on in 2016: disrupting an election by scrambling the databases of registered voters that precinct workers rely on to check voters‚<U+0080><U+0099> eligibility on Election Day. Here, too, states are battening down their computer networks. Some states have installed Department of Homeland Security-approved monitors on state or local computer systems to spot malware and attacks from rogue IP addresses; 33 states undergo weekly ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cyberhygiene‚<U+0080>ù reviews conducted remotely by the agency. Perhaps the biggest unplugged hole, according to Mr. Chapin of the University of Minnesota, is the lack of security precautions in smaller jurisdictions ‚<U+0080><U+0094> small cities and rural counties where managing elections is a part-time job, often farmed out to local representatives of national makers of election computer systems. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The old line about a chain only being as strong as its weakest link is true, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Capin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One person who gives up access to a server can create tremendous problems for everybody.‚<U+0080>ù West Virginia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cyberdefenses began with a built-in advantage: State law requires that hand-countable paper ballots be used in every election. Even if voting machines were altered to try to sway election results, the ballots guarantee that the true outcome of a race could still be determined. The state also demands other safeguards. Voting machines are tested before and after elections to ensure that a set of mock votes are reported identically; testers also reset the machines‚<U+0080><U+0099> internal clocks to Election Day to spot any malware programmed to alter results on that one day and then self-destruct. The other tempting target for hackers, the statewide voter registration database, also is tightly guarded. In 2016, Russian hackers broke into one such database, in Illinois, by exploiting a flaw in a web page that allowed citizens to register or change registrations online. In West Virginia and many other states, the database is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>air-gapped‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> cut off from public access. Online registrations are hosted on a separate computer, and new data is hand-carried to the main database on a thumb drive. Advertisement The database does have a vulnerability: Some 300 workers in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 55 county clerk‚<U+0080><U+0099>s offices regulary log in to it to update local registrants‚<U+0080><U+0099> information. Passwords pilfered from those offices could provide a hostile power with an avenue to change or destroy voters‚<U+0080><U+0099> information. But there, too, security has been tightened. The county clerks regularly meet by phone for briefings on cybersecurity issues like password management. Last year Mr. Warner participated in cyberwar games ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a simulated attack on an American election by a hostile power ‚<U+0080><U+0094> staged by the Defending Digital Democracy project at Harvard University‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Mr. Warner was so impressed, he said, that he asked the head of West Virginia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s county clerks‚<U+0080><U+0099> association to attend a reprise of the exercise. The war games, he said, taught him that even the most secure election system will be attacked and perhaps even cracked ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>speed of recovery‚<U+0080>ù is the key to keeping voters‚<U+0080><U+0099> confidence in the results high. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It gave me a comfort level as a new secretary of state that, yes, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to be attacked, and when it happens, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t freak, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to have your detection capabilities up to know when it happens.

Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, accused him of physically assaulting them. Almost immediately after the article was published, calls for Mr. Schneiderman to resign came pouring in from officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Schneiderman, 63, has contested the allegations in statements. Still, late on Monday, he announced his resignation. Here is a look at Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s career, including his yearslong defense of women and his rise to prominence as a foil to the Trump administration. Advertisement [Read our article about the accusations.] Mr. Schneiderman graduated from Amherst College in 1977 and Harvard Law School in 1982, according to a biography on the attorney general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website. As a public interest lawyer, Mr. Schneiderman represented women seeking access to health clinics, sometimes suing protesters who he said harassed the women outside of the clinics. Along the way, he expressed support for codifying the Roe v. Wade decision into state law. Mr. Schneiderman also spent 15 years in private practice before leaving to begin a successful campaign for the State Senate. He was elected in 1998 and seated the next year. On Nov. 2, 2010, he was elected as the 65th attorney general of New York, making him the chief law enforcement officer of the state. He had been up for re-election this year. Mr. Schneiderman had been outspoken about women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s issues throughout his career. In 2010, while he was still a state senator from Manhattan, he introduced a bill to make intentional strangulation to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. That same year, the National Organization for Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s New York branch endorsed him in his successful bid for attorney general, citing his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unmatched work‚<U+0080>ù in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>protecting women who are victims of domestic abuse.‚<U+0080>ù While Mr. Schneiderman was attorney general, his office, for several years, published a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Know Your Rights‚<U+0080>ù brochure for victims of domestic violence. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We must recognize that our work keeping New Yorkers safe from domestic violence is far from over, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman said in the announcement for the 2016 brochure.

Recently, he pushed himself to the forefront of the #MeToo movement, announcing a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have never seen anything as despicable as what we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen right here, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman said at the time. Advertisement At the direction of Governor Cuomo, he was also reviewing the 2015 decision by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her. Mr. Schneiderman was widely seen as harboring ambitions to be governor. His biography notes that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>where Washington D.C. has failed to lead on the issues that matter, Eric has made clear that New York will provide a road map for the rest of the country.‚<U+0080>ù He had also raised his profile nationally by repeatedly taking on President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agenda in the courts. (Mr. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct, though he has denied the allegations.) Even before Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Schneiderman had filed a lawsuit against Trump University. And more recently, he had been pushing to change state law so his office could prosecute Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s aides if the president pardons them. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Since November of 2016, Eric has led the fight to protect New Yorkers from the most harmful policies of the Trump Administration, ‚<U+0080>ù his biography says. Among the other actions Mr. Schneiderman lists on the attorney general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website: ‚<U+0080>¢ He successfully sued to block what he called President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Muslim Ban.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080>¢ He said he was taking the Trump administration to court over energy-efficiency standards. ‚<U+0080>¢ He said he was defending the rights of sanctuary cities in his state.

But two of the best hitting teams in baseball may find at least one thing to their liking: the dimensions of London Stadium. The teams will play Major League Baseball‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first games in England on June 29 and 30, 2019, at the stadium that was designed to host the 2012 Olympics. The center-field fence will be an inviting target, just 385 feet from home plate under the preliminary configuration of stadium, which will accommodate 55,000 spectators. The closest center field wall in baseball is at the Red Sox‚<U+0080><U+0099> Fenway Park, where the 17-foot high wall is 390 feet from home plate. It quickly juts out to 420 feet in right-center field and is adjoined by the Green Monster to the left. The wall at London Stadium will be between 12 and 14 feet high between the power alleys. Advertisement The power alleys will be 375 feet and the foul lines 333 feet with an 8-foot fence running between the alleys and the foul poles. Dimensions will be finalized in September. Those dimensions would be a boon for Mookie Betts of the Red Sox, who leads the major leagues with 13 home runs, and the Yankees sluggers, Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Gary Sanchez. Entering Tuesday, the Red Sox are leading baseball with a .460 slugging percentage, and the Yankees are tied for second with 48 home runs.

The Red Sox (25-9) lead the Yankees (24-10) by one game in the American League East and have the two best records in baseball. The Red Sox will be the home team for both London games next season. M.L.B. has agreed to play another series there in 2020 with the participating teams to be announced. Several regular-season series outside the mainland United States and Canada have been scheduled recently. The Cleveland Indians and the Minnesota Twins played a two-game series last month in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The latter pledge, which bid officials said was delivered in a letter to FIFA last week, could reassure FIFA members that a travel ban put in place by President Trump would not block some officials or fans from traveling to the tournament. The Trump administration, through an executive order, has sought to block visitors to the United States from a handful of countries, including five Muslim-majority nations. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month on a third version of the travel ban. A decision is expected by the end of June, the same month FIFAís member associations will vote on the 2026 host. The United States is bidding in a partnership with Mexico and Canada against Moroccoís solo bid. FIFA will pick a winner at its congress in Moscow on June 13, one day before the opening match of the World Cup in Russia. The promises about record revenues and profits and the reassurances about travel visas were delivered Tuesday by the three chairmen of the North American bid ó U.S. Soccerís president, Carlos Cordeiro; Decio De MarÌa, the president of Mexicoís federation; and Peter Montopoli, the Canadian Soccer Association general secretary ó during a presentation at the congress of the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) in Brussels. The projected profit of $11 billion would be more than double that of any previous tournament, in part because the 2026 event will be the first to include 48 teams and 80 matches, an expansion from the current 32 teams and 64 matches. De MarÌa said the United States governmentís assurances that it would allow entry to ìall eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the worldî were in line with FIFAís requirements and would not draw distinctions based on race, religion or national origin. In his prepared remarks, he called them ìstrong guarantees.î But De MarÌa also noted the pledges were ìsubject to United States law,î which seemed to leave open the possibility that the promises would be limited if the Supreme Court upholds the travel ban. One of the countries on the banned list, Iran, qualified for both the 2014 and 2018 World Cups. The revenue figures laid out by Cordeiro during the presentation painted a far rosier picture, and possibly a welcome one inside FIFA, which has lost millions of dollars in sponsorships and millions more in legal costs in the years since a massive corruption scandal rocked the organization in 2015. Cordeiro predicted ìthe most successful and profitable FIFA World Cup ever,î with revenues of $14 billion from a North American tournament and profits for FIFA of nearly $11 billion, not to mention entree to a market with the kind of sponsors who fled FIFA after the corruption scandal. The revenue projections include more than $5 billion in television rights fees; $3.6 billion for sponsorship and licensing; and at least $2.5 billion in ticket revenue. All of the figures, as well as the prospect of 5.8 million tickets sold, would be records for a World Cup. (FIFA, for example, projects revenue of only $6.56 billion for the four-year World Cup cycle that includes the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.) But the sums also would be, in Cordeiroís words, ìin the best interests of football,î producing money that could be reinvested into the game by its members. ìA profit of this magnitude is unprecedented in any single-sport event in the world,î Cordeiro said in an interview with AIPS members after the presentation. ìThat has to sink in. In terms of value, it could mean $50 million more per association.î Moroccoís bid team, making its own presentation at the AIPS conference, seemed to acknowledge that it could not match the revenue projections of its North American rival. In its bid, Morocco has played up its outsider status; unlike the United States and Mexico, it has never hosted the World Cup. It also has sought to win support from the many developing nations in FIFA and has needled the North American bid by touting its ìvery low gun circulation.î ìThe World Cup is not attributed only on the number of seats you offer in stadiums or on who makes more money,î its chief executive, Hicham El Amrani, told AIPS members. ìWe will make enough money to make FIFA profitable.î"

They know Turing, the cryptologist who cracked the Nazi Enigma code, helped win World War II. And they remember Turing as a martyr for gay rights who, after being prosecuted and sentenced to chemical castration, committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide in 1954. But few have heard of Turing, the naturalist who explained patterns in nature with math. Nearly half a century after publishing his final paper in 1952, chemists and biological mathematicians came to appreciate the power of his late work to explain problems they were solving, like how zebrafish get their stripes or cheetahs get spots. And even now, scientists are finding new insights from Turingís legacy. Most recently, in a paper published Thursday in Science, chemical engineers in China used pattern generation described by Turing to explain a more efficient process for water desalination, which is increasingly being used to provide freshwater for drinking and irrigation in arid places. Turingís 1952 paper did not explicitly address the filtering of saltwater through membranes to produce freshwater. Instead, he used chemistry to explain how undifferentiated balls of cells generated form in organisms. Itís unclear why this interested the early computer scientist, but Turing had told a friend that he wanted to defeat Argument From Design, the idea that for complex patterns to exist in nature, something supernatural, like God, had to create them. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] A keen natural observer since childhood, Turing noticed that many plants contained clues that math might be involved. Some plant traits emerged as Fibonacci numbers. These were part of a series: Each number equals the sum of the two preceding numbers. Daisies, for example, had 34, 55 or 89 petals. ìHe certainly was no militant atheist,î said Jonathan Swinton, a computational biologist and visiting professor at the University of Oxford who has researched Turingís later work and life. ìHe just thought mathematics was very powerful, and you could use it to explain lots and lots of things ó and you should try.î And try, Turing did. ìHe came up with a mathematical representation that allows form to emerge from blankness,î said Dr. Swinton. In Turingís model, two chemicals he called morphogens interacted on a blank arena. ìSuppose youíve got two of these, and one will make the skin of an animal go black and the skin of the animal go white,î explained Dr. Swinton. ìIf you just mix these things in an arena, what you get is a gray animal.î But if something caused one chemical to diffuse, or spread, faster than the other, then each chemical could concentrate in evenly spaced localized spots, together forming black and white spots or stripes. This is known as a ìTuring instability,î and, the Chinese researchers who published the new paper determined that it could explain the way shapes emerged in salt-filtering membranes. By creating three-dimensional Turing patterns like bubbles and tubes in membranes, the researchers increased their permeability, creating filters that could better separate salt from water than traditional ones. ìWe can use one membrane to finish the work of two or three,î said Zhe Tan, a graduate student at Zheijang University in China and first author of the paper, which means less energy and lower cost if used for large-scale desalination operations in the future. Beyond his final publication, Turingís notes revealed the complicated ideas he was wrestling to explain. ìThe 1952 paper that everybody knows is not the end of the story,î said Jonathan Dawes, a mathematician at the University of Bath who has also been trying to make sense of Turingís later work. ìIt doesnít show the full depth of his thinking.î Turing appeared to be looking for a general mechanism for the creation of form ó like how thought or consciousness spontaneously emerges or how sunflowers neatly pack their seeds together. But Turing would die before completing and publishing his final musings. ìWhat I hope we appreciate more because of him, is to value diversity and individual creativity in our science base,î Dr. Dawes said. ìWe need people who we allow to be driven by their curiosity, and we also need people who will take those basic science ideas and turn them into useful technology.î"

Now it has 1,300 ó and counting.","Michael Cooper, Toya Sarno Jordan",Arts,Lifestyle,"K-12 Education, Classical music, Baltimore Symphony Orchestra,, Marin Alsop","BALTIMORE ó From the outside, Lockerman-Bundy Elementary School looks forbidding, a tan monolith built in the 1970s. Some of the rowhouses across the street are boarded up ó reminders of the cycles of poverty and abandonment this city has struggled with for years. Inside on an afternoon last month, though, it was a different story. Music echoed through brightly colored halls lined with murals. Classes were over, but school was not out: Young string players rehearsed Beethoven in one classroom, while flutists practiced in another and brass players worked on fanfares in a third. Also on offer were homework tutors, an after-school snack and dinner. ìFour measures for nothing,î Wade Davis, a cello teacher, called out to his young string section, launching them into Beethovenís ìOde to Joy.î Standing outside the classroom, Carol Moore wiped away tears as she peered through the doorway at her son, Jayden, 11, who was playing viola. ìIím so proud of all of them,î she said. It was just another afternoon at OrchKids, the free after-school program that the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and its music director, Marin Alsop, started a decade ago with just 30 children in a single school. The program now reaches 1,300 students in six schools; its participants have gone on to win scholarships to prestigious summer music programs; play with famous musicians, including the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis; perform at halftime at a Baltimore Ravens game; and win accolades at the White House. The program was the idea of Ms. Alsop, who began thinking about how to forge closer ties to the city soon after she became Baltimoreís music director ó and the first woman to lead a major American symphony orchestra ó in 2007. ìIím deeply distressed that our concert halls, our stages, donít reflect the diversity of our communities,î she said in an interview. ìHow are we going to change that landscape?î She got the program off the ground by pledging $100,000 of her own money ó part of a MacArthur ìgeniusî grant she won in 2005 ó as a match to encourage other donors. There were bumps along the way. The first school to house OrchKids was shut down after a year, forcing the program to replant itself at Lockerman-Bundy. The first student to enroll in the program was Keith Fleming, then a first grader. ìAt first I didnít really like music,î he recalled recently. ìI just thought, Iím going to do this because I didnít really have something else to do. The first day came, and I started to learn music ó and I started to like it.î He is 15 now, and his tuba skills have taken him to Austria and London and helped him win an audition to the Baltimore School of the Arts, where he is a sophomore. Asia Palmer, a flute player in her 10th year with the program, said that for her the highlight had been meeting Michelle Obama at the White House in 2013, when Ms. Palmer accepted an award on behalf of the program. ìThe program has given me a voice,î she said. ìI feel like I can be whatever, do whatever ó strive.î OrchKids offers a respite from troubles that often come disturbingly close to home; in 2015, five people were shot just a block from the school, close to dismissal time. It is also a bright spot in a city that has seen more than its share of troubles ó including the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody; the riots that followed; and being named the city with the highest per capita murder rate in 2017 by USA Today. The program was partly inspired by El Sistema, Venezuelaís free music education program, which Nick Skinner, the OrchKids director of operations, visited to get ideas for the program. These days El Sistemaís future in Venezuela, which is facing a grave economic crisis, is in some doubt. But its ideals have taken root elsewhere. ìFrom the very beginning,î Mr. Skinner said, ìit was very important that we were immersed in the school, and in the community.î In 2005, the Baltimore Symphony began playing some of its concerts at Strathmore, in North Bethesda, Md., a suburb of Washington, making it the rare orchestra with two homes. OrchKids showed that its commitment to its hometown remained strong. The orchestra has enjoyed recent artistic successes ó it will tour Europe this summer for the first time in 13 years ó but, like many ensembles, it has struggled financially. Its annual budget of just over $28 million is less than half of the New York Philharmonicís. But it spends more than $1 million a year on OrchKids, said Peter Kjome, its president and chief executive officer. The program, he said, appeals to some philanthropists who donít give to traditional performing arts organizations but do support educational and social justice initiatives. This year the orchestra announced a $65 million fund-raising drive ó $10 million of which will be devoted to OrchKids and its youth orchestra program. Ms. Alsop wants OrchKids to grow to 5,000 students in the next five years, and 10,000 in the next 10. (ìThey donít like it when I say these things,î she said wryly.) The program celebrated its 10th anniversary earlier this month with a concert at the neo-Classical War Memorial, across from City Hall. In the audience was Kimberly Hill-Miller, the principal at Lockerman-Bundy. She said the program had benefited the school in ways that went beyond music, noting that students who joined OrchKids generally had better attendance and academic performance than their peers. ìKids need some kind of outlet,î she said. ìItís definitely needed.î Baltimoreís mayor, Catherine Pugh, not only attended the concert but also picked up a pair of drumsticks to jam on the steps of the War Memorial with the OrchKids bucket band, led by Brian Prechtl, a Baltimore Symphony percussionist. ìEvery time they step out, theyíre a positive image of our city,î said Ms. Pugh, who added that she would like to see OrchKids expand. Then it was time for the concert in the grand marble hall. Shortly before taking the podium to conduct an orchestra of nearly 250 students ó some seated at a row of short, child-friendly harps ó Ms. Alsop thanked the parents, teachers, school staff, donors, politicians and volunteers present. ìWhen people say, ëOh, youíre from Baltimore,í they have that look,î Ms. Alsop told the audience. (Some nodded knowingly.) ìI tell them that Baltimore is about community,î she went on. ìBaltimore is about possibility. Baltimore is about future.î Then she led the young orchestra in a mash-up of the ìOde to Joyî and ìConqueror,î by Estelle. The practice at Lockerman-Bundy had paid off. The kids brought the house down."

The stateís attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, captured the partyís nomination and is expected to mount an aggressive challenge this fall against Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat who is a top target of Republicans in their struggle to hang on to their one-seat Senate majority in the midterm elections in November. Mr. Blankenship, who called himself ìTrumpier Than Trump,î drew on elements of the presidentís own populist playbook, including nativist attacks and charges of conspiracy leveled at the Obama-era Justice Department that prosecuted him for his role in the 2010 mine explosion, which killed 29 men. But Washington Republican leaders badly wanted Mr. Blankenship to lose, with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, coordinating an effort to derail him. At Mr. McConnellís urging, Mr. Trump on Monday warned ìthe great people of West Virginiaî in a tweet that Mr. Blankenship could not win the general election against Senator Manchin. Mr. Blankenship said Tuesday night that he thought the tweet cost him 10 percentage points or more. Mr. Blankenship ran a nonpoliticianís race from start to finish. His TV ads were on the air months before those of other candidates, and rather than emphasizing his conservative bona fides ó the chief driver of voters in a Republican primary ó he spent deeply from his fortune to attack the Justice Department for his conviction. Unpredictable to the end, Mr. Blankenship went shopping for a new suit in Charleston on Tuesday rather than campaigning. Hours later, at his election-night event at a modest-size corporate ballroom in a Marriott hotel, he took the stage after only about 35 percent of votes were in to deliver a sort-of concession speech in a matter-of-fact tone. There were more journalists than supporters in the room, including two Mandarin speakers from the Voice of America, who said they were broadcasting into China because of interest there over racially offensive comments by Mr. Blankenship. ìThe news so far is not very good,î he told the audience. ìWeíre really disappointed by some of the votes in the northern panhandle,î he continued. ìAt this point itís not nearly what I hoped it would be.î Then Mr. Blankenship asked whether anyone had questions, and fielded them from both supporters and reporters. He said he may not endorse Mr. Morrisey, repeating campaign attacks that the attorney general is not strongly enough opposed to abortion or opioids. And he was inconclusive about whether he would mount a third-party bid, as he had earlier floated. By 9:30 p.m., the hotel caterers cleared away the last of the West Virginia apple butter glazed chicken sate and shrimp skewers. Many in West Virginia speculated that Mr. Blankenship, 68, was running primarily to seek personal redemption, or was waging a vendetta against Mr. Manchin. (The retired coal executive denied those were his motives.) In any case, Mr. Blankenship dug deeply into his personal fortune for some $2 million on TV and digital ads, far more than his rivals, which early on touched a nerve with the stateís anti-establishment voters, including in the southern coal fields. Some miners and minersí families echoed Mr. Blankenshipís charges that he had been railroaded. In the final stretch, Mr. Blankenship turned his fire on Senator McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, calling him ìCocaine Mitchî for an obscure claim that a ship connected to Mr. McConnellís father-in-law was found with smuggled drugs. In an ad released last week, he claimed ìSwamp Captain Mitch McConnell has given millions of jobs to China People,î an allusion to the shipping business run by the father of Mr. McConnellís wife, Elaine Chao, Mr. Trumpís secretary of transportation. Mr. Blankenshipís animus toward Mr. McConnell flared after a ìsuper PACî with ties to the majority leader ran ads in West Virginia calling the former coal executive unelectable and ìa convicted criminal.î Mr. McConnellís allies delighted in the rebuke Tuesday night. ìIt turns out that Blankenshipís racist dog whistle played a lot louder with Washington reporters than with West Virginia primary voters,î said Steven Law, who runs the Senate Leadership Fund, a McConnell-aligned super PAC. Mr. Trumpís warning to West Virginia Republicans and independents to ignore Mr. Blankenship because he would be a weak candidate in November seemed to give little pause to those who voted for him. ìI donít think itís true,î said Chris Wilder, 32, who provides services to coal mines in Madison, W.Va. ìIt kind of threw it for a loop there,î he acknowledged with a chuckle. National Republicans believed that Mr. Blankenship would have cost them a winnable Senate seat just as in Alabama last year, when primary voters chose Roy S. Moore, who was accused by several women of making sexual advances toward them as teenagers. In a deeply red state, Mr. Moore lost the general election to Doug Jones, a Democrat. After more than $1 million in TV attack ads by the McConnell-aligned super PAC last month, polls showed Mr. Blankenship slipping behind two conventional rivals, Mr. Morrisey and Mr. Jenkins. But he surged after a Fox News debate on May 1 ó indicative of national interest in the race ó in which Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Morrisey mainly attacked each other. Over the weekend, Mr. Morrisey finally leveled his sights on Mr. Blankenship, calling him a convicted criminal and on Monday sending a letter to his Nevada probation officer, accusing Mr. Blankenship of breaking the law by not filing a financial disclosure. Mr. Blankenship, raised in poverty in Mingo County, W.Va., now lives principally outside Las Vegas, in a $2.4 million villa, where he is under supervised release from his prison sentence. He failed to file a personal financial disclosure with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, as required. Mr. Blankenship told The New York Times last month that he felt no pressure to file the disclosure because there isnít ìmuch of a penalty.î Mr. Morrisey is a conservative battler who sued the Obama administration repeatedly over environmental regulation. But he will also surely face sharp Democratic attacks: He is a transplant from New Jersey who once worked as a Washington lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry, running in a state ravaged by the opioid epidemic. Mr. Manchin, 70, who is one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, has managed to retain popularity at home as Democrats elected statewide in West Virginia have become all but extinct. He won his most recent election, in 2012, in a near landslide with 60 percent of the vote even as the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, carried every county. In Congress, Mr. Manchin opposed President Barack Obamaís climate change proposals and worked with Republicans on abortion and gun ownership. But he has refused repeated efforts to get him to switch parties, saying that when he grew up, Republicans were the party of the rich, and he did not know any rich people."

Technically, the faintly lustrous silk duchesse satin overskirt was still being affixed to her at the instant of communion by a knelt helper fastening a semicircle of hooks and eyes around her waist. But time was running out (technically, time had run out 30 minutes earlier). And so, even though the Bronx-born rapper and self-identified Catholic might have preferred to be untweaked and unjostled during her moment of devotion, allowances had to be made. The prayer of thanksgiving was led by her publicist, Patientce Foster. ìThank you for Jeremy Scott,î said Ms. Foster, her voice rushing out with the calm efficiency of a cool brook. Mr. Scott, Cardiís date for the Met Gala last night, and, as the creative director of Moschino, the man responsible for her tulle and wool and buckles and gems, was standing behind Cardi, reverently running the tips of his fingers across the satin overskirt as she shut her eyes in silent prayer. ìWe appreciate our friendship with Moschino,î said Ms. Foster, to God. ìWe ask that this night be successful, Lord. That you grace her feet, that you grace her presence, Lord. That she walks the carpet with everything that she has, Lord. That she gives everything that she has. We ask all these blessings in your name. Amen.î ìAmen,î said Cardi B, designing an invisible cross in the air above her slightly sparkling face. ìOkurrr!î added a few members of Cardiís team, filling the room in the Carlyle Hotel with the sounds of an avian chorus. (ìOkurrr,î with a trilled r, is one of Cardiís signature exclamations. The association of Cardi with ìokurrrî has become so strong that the hotel embroidered the interjection on one of her roomís pillowcases.) One year ago, Cardiís sensational single ìBodak Yellowî had not yet been released, and she had to watch her more famous boyfriend (now fiancÈ) Offset, of the rap group Migos, dress for an ultraexclusive event to which she had never been invited. This year, on the 70th anniversary of the gala, she is, in the words of Mr. Scott, ìobviously the girl that everyoneís after. Sheís that new appointed pop princess. Diva, soon to be queen.î That Cardiís first Met Gala should fall on a night honoring the Costume Instituteís exhibition ìHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imaginationî was serendipitous, given her tremendous affection for God. Her brief to Mr. Scott was that her gown be ìvery religiousî and ìvery luxurious.î She was pleased that the final result reminded her of papal finery. ìPopes wear big things with rubies and gems,î she explained, perhaps picturing less of a Pope Francis than one of those Medici popes, like the profligate Leo X, whose endorsement of the sale of indulgences led Martin Luther to instigate the Protestant Reformation. Mr. Scott, who frequently dresses Cardi in bold retro rainbow colors for performances, said her outfit was ìvery inspired by Vatican tapestries ó the whole, kind of, embroidery of deities.î The dramatic coronal headpiece was meant to evoke the Virgin Mary. ìYou know,î said Mr. Scott, ìlike Mary, she is pregnant. But she know who the baby daddy is.î The dazzling companion suit to Cardiís outfit, sported by Mr. Scott at the Gala, was originally intended to be worn by Offset. Then, after work had begun on the custom wool and pearl motorcycle jacket/tuxedo coat hybrid (with matching trousers), it was decided that all three members of Migos would, in fact, attend the party as guests of Versace, whose chief designer Donatella Versace was one of the Met Galaís co-chairs. Fortunately, the trim Mr. Scott is roughly the same size as Offset. Like the priceless vestments passed down through centuries currently on display in the exhibit, the ensemble was handed down to him. Although Cardi seemed happy to attend the party as Mr. Scottís date, dismay at the Versace intervention lingered. An hour or so before her official gala entrance, a blend of deep red lipsticks was painstakingly applied to her frown while she sat, robed, in a chair, and worried over Offsetís replacement outfit. ìItís like, if yíall got so much people going with yíall, yíall could have just let him walk with me and take the two boys,î she said, referencing Versaceís extra-long list of guests (which included Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian West and Tom Brady) and the other two members of Migos: Takeoff and Quavo. The circumstances, she said, had left her ìupset.î ìThatís why my baby ainít never gonna stand out,î she said quietly. ìWhat do you mean?î asked Ms. Foster, who was floating around the room checking on every single element of everything, while simultaneously coordinating Cardiís schedule for the next day, and occasionally breaking into song. ìLike, stand out on his own?î ìNot even on his own,î said Cardi. ìItís just like, I know how he wants to be.î (All three members of Migos eventually appeared on the Metís steps in matching color-coordinated Atelier Versace tuxedos.) One baby that would stand out at the Met Gala was the fetus currently gestating inside Cardi. Mr. Scott said he designed her dress to ìgloss over her, which is what I thought would be best for her figure.î The snug fit and high belt emphasized her round stomach, even if the individual hand beading proved a little cumbersome for an expectant woman. ìExtremely heavy,î is how Cardi characterized her outfit. ìThe beading is just crazy, and then,î she said, cradling her midsection, ìshorty weighs three and a half pounds.î This news was met with laughs of delight from those assembled. ìShe do,î said Cardi. ìShe do weigh three and a half pounds. Thatís pretty good for seven months, right?î she asked, looking around. ìBecause I was born five pounds.î The atmosphere inside the hotel suite cycled quickly between rapture and rupture. Ms. Foster and Cardiís warm, lanky stylist, Kollin Carter, led goofy champagne toasts (in which the pregnant rapper did not partake). Cardi excitedly recounted past Met Gala themes, recalling their chronology better than anyone in the room. But her mood plummeted when she was alerted to the fact that a fan-run Instagram account had posted a video of a recent confrontation involving herself, a member of her security team and a fan in Las Vegas. She expressed her frustration with a torrent of harsh words, many of them criticizing the security guard who, she argued, had inflamed the situation. She watched the video multiple times on her phone, becoming increasingly irritated with every replay. She asked Ms. Foster to contact the fan account and request its owner remove the video. The bustling room fell silent, save for the furious clicks of Cardiís nails against iPhone glass, as, amid this social media Sturm und Drang, Mr. Scottís towering headpiece was gently positioned atop her head. There was nervous speculation about the best way to fasten it in place using the provided set of combs and ribbon ties. People half-joked about being afraid to hold the fragile object. It was a jeweled retaining wall barely holding back cascading black waves of hair. ìI feel like thatís perfect,î said Ms. Foster, after a series of minute adjustments. Immediately, the crown fell. For a moment, Cardi said nothing. She could say nothing, for the incredibly delicate and expensive headpiece was smushed up against her carefully painted lips. As it was lifted, she declared to the room with cold, quiet fury, ìThis is why I said matte lipstick. íCause it smudge.î She was correct: Her lipstick had smudged. None of the beadwork had broken, but a few perfectly white pearls had been stained pink. Ms. Foster began individually swabbing them clean with Q-Tips. A judiciously placed FaceTime call from Cardiís younger sister, Hennessy, lifted her mood tremendously. ìSlay!î Hennessy screamed through the speaker as she admired Cardiís gown. ìSlay!î The effect was of air whipped into a meringue. ìI wanna cry!î exclaimed Cardi giddily a few moments later, as holes were snipped in her jeweled gloves so that her jeweled nails could poke through. A handshake with her at this point felt like a handshake with a very expensive lizard. She turned to Ms. Foster. ìYou donít wanna cry?î ìI wanna drink,î said Ms. Foster. She poured herself a glass of champagne. (Celebratory.) Cardiís voluminous skirt took up most of the cramped hotel elevator. It took up most of wherever she was, in fact. After wading through a crowd of screaming onlookers gathered outside the hotel to see a celebrity, any celebrity, she was forced to stand in the extra-large van hired to transport her the few blocks from the hotel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When a member of the Moschino team asked ìHow you doiní, Mama?î Cardi responded ìAh?î She was unable to turn her body around, or swivel her head to see past her mass of hair, to determine the source of the question. ìWhoís talking to me right now?î she asked with a laugh. Cardi practiced her pose, which was: hands at sides. As the automobile crawled slowly forward, she was able, by a series of very meticulous adjustments, to position herself so that she was kneeling on the first row of back seats, facing out the rear window. Through careful manipulation of her embellished gloves and dagger sharp acrylic nails bearing more jewels than the earthís crust, she entered her iPhoneís passcode. She began refreshing the hashtag #CardiB on Instagram, anxious to see how her dress had looked on the seconds-long walk from the hotel to the van, and to glean peopleís reactions to it. ìYou donít want óî she began, and cut herself off, scrolling nervously through search results. (As well as countless posts recycling the same few images from her short stroll, the hashtag also revealed occasional spam of nude strangers.) ìThe first picture goes viral. Always. And you donít want the first picture to be terrible.î Mercifully, Cardi had only a few minutes to stress about the quality of the first frantic photos of herself and Mr. Scott. Less than half a mile later, it was time for her real trial: Getting her dress out of the van."

Directorís Salary Is Reduced to $209,700 From $375,000","The pay cut for Dr. Robert Redfield, the newly appointed agency chief, came about after senators and the public questioned why his salary was much higher than his predecessorsí.",Sheila Kaplan,Health,Health,"US Politics, CDC, Executive Compensation, Robert R. Redfield, Health and Human Services","WASHINGTON ó The new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking a pay cut after Senate Democrats and watchdog groups criticized the use of an exemption to pay him nearly double the rate of his predecessors. Dr. Robert R. Redfield assumed the top post in March at a salary of $375,000 per year, far more than the heads of many other federal agencies, and much more than his predecessors Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald ($193,700), Dr. Thomas Frieden ($209,700), and Dr. Julie Gerberding ($207,000). The unusually high rate was granted under a provision known as Title 42, which permits the Department of Health and Human Services (and the Environmental Protection Agency) to pay more than the approved government rate if the candidate fills a specific scientific need that cannot otherwise be met. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, questioned the use of the exemption in this case, suggesting last month that it might not have been appropriate. She asked the health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, who oversees the C.D.C., to describe the ìextensive and exhaustive effortî that was supposed to be made to find a director before hiring Dr. Redfield at the unusually high salary. The fallout was swift. A few days after news reports about the criticism, the Health and Human Services Department indicated that Dr. Redfield was seeking to have his salary reduced. Caitlin B. Oakley, a spokeswoman for the department, said on Tuesday that Dr. Redfield had agreed to a lower salary of $209,700. ìDr. Redfield did not want his compensation to become a distraction from the important work of the C.D.C. and asked that his salary be reduced,î Ms. Oakley said. ìDr. Redfield is being paid in accordance with the formula used to pay the prior three C.D.C. directors.î Ms. Oakley repeated the departmentís rationale for recruiting Dr. Redfield under Title 42, calling it a rare opportunity to hire one of the worldís leading virologists. Dr. Redfield was a longtime H.I.V./AIDS researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and a founder of its Institute of Human Virology. Dr. Redfield became the director after Dr. Fitzgerald resigned under fire in January, because of a series of potential conflicts of interest arising from financial investments she and her husband had made. Senator Murray was not available for comment."

He was 70. His death was announced by the university, which did not specify the cause. Mr. Steger, a Virginia Tech graduate who spent most of his professional career there, was president of the university from 2000 to 2014. He drew praise as a steady hand after a gunman killed 32 faculty members and students on April 16, 2007. But he also faced blistering criticism from the parents of shooting victims and others for not warning the campus sooner that the shooter had killed two students in a residence hall. More than two hours after the residence hall shooting, when an alert was issued, the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, killed 30 more students and faculty members in a classroom building before turning a gun on himself as police closed in. Mr. Steger defended his actions and resisted calls to resign. ìWe did the best we could knowing what we knew at the time,î he told The Associated Press in an interview in 2013, when he announced his retirement.

He left a private-sector career in 1976 to teach at Virginia Tech. He was a faculty member, college dean, acting vice president for public service and vice president for development and university relations before becoming president. During Mr. Stagerís time as president, Virginia Tech increased its enrollment, raised more than $1 billion in private funding, formed a school of biomedical engineering, created a public-private school of medicine and joined the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The internet is here to unpack it.,Judy Berman,Arts,Entertainment,Donald Glover;Childish Gambino,"In his opening monologue as the host of ìSaturday Night Liveî last weekend, Donald Glover quipped: ìIím an actor, a writer and a singer. Some people have described me as a triple threat. But I kind of like to call myself just a threat.î As if to drive home the point that heís scarily talented, Glover, who created and stars in the surreal FX comedy ìAtlantaî was also the episodeís musical guest, performing two new songs as his hip-hop alter ego, Childish Gambino. The music video for one of those tracks, ìThis Is America,î appeared the same night, and it suggests that he is actually a quadruple threat: He can dance, too. But Gloverís graceful moves arenít exactly the point. Thereís plenty of messaging about race, violence and the entertainment industry in the song and video ó which helps explain why fans and critics have devoted so much time to dissecting its references and debating its meaning. Here are some of their sharpest insights. (Excerpts below are unedited.) ëUnpacking All the References in Childish Gambinoís Phenomenal New Videoí [Dazed] ìThis Is Americaî is dense with allusions to American history and pop culture. Natty Kasambala assembles a list of footnotes to the video, from its Jim Crow imagery to Gloverís references to other musicians. ëChildish Gambinoís Video Grabs You by the Throatí [CNN] ìWhat Gambino put together is a true picture of America, where so many of us get to dance and sing and laugh and create,î writes Isaac Bailey. ìAll the while others are largely ignored and trapped in the background, struggling and sometimes dying in a sea of ugliness that many of us would rather not acknowledge, knowing it would ruin the pretty pictures weíd rather focus on.î ëThe Carnage and Chaos of Childish Gambinoís ìThis Is Americaî Videoí [The New Yorker] Doreen St. FÈlix notes that ìThe video has already been rapturously described as a powerful rally cry against gun violence, a powerful portrait of black-American existentialism, a powerful indictment of a culture that circulates videos of black children dying as easily as it does videos of black children dancing in parking lots.î She continues: ìIt is those things, but it also a fundamentally ambiguous document. The truth is that this video, and what it suggests about its artist, is very difficult. A lot of black people hate it. Glover forces us to relive public traumas and barely gives us a second to breathe before he forces us to dance.î Justin Simien Breaks Down ëThis Is Americaí on Twitter In an appreciative Twitter thread Sunday night, Justin Simien, the creator of Netflixís ìDear White People,î analyzed the imagery of ìThis Is Americaî and concluded that the video asked black viewers, ìHow can those of us granted a moment in the proverbial spotlight just use it to entertain ourselves to death?î He continued: ìItís a challenge and a series of questions. Like art should be.î ëWhat It Means When Childish Gambino Says ìThis Is Americaîí [Vulture] Frank Guan analyzes the lyrics of ìThis Is America,î which draw heavily on trap music, a gritty rap subgenre with its origins in Atlanta. ìThe incongruousness of Glover, raised middle-class and a NYU graduate, bragging about his Mexican drug supplier and threatening to have you gunned down, is intentional,î he writes. ìItís a tribute to the cultural dominance of trap music and a reflection on the ludicrous social logic that made the environment from which trap emerges, the logic where money makes the man, and every black man is a criminal.î ëDonald Gloverís ìThis Is Americaî Is a Stylish, Ambitious Provocation ó But What Is It Actually Selling?í [Vanity Fair] K. Austin Collins takes issue with Gloverís critique of black Americaís complicity in the violence that plagues it. ìIím wary of any claim that ëWeí are distracted from black violence,î he writes, ìbecause whoís ëwe,í really? Every other day of the week, Americaís complaint is that the blacks doth protest too much.î ëMaking Donald Glover the ìAnti-Kanyeî Is Gross and Wrong and Will Backfire, So Please Donítí [The Root] Damon Young points out the danger of setting up Glover as the antidote to another black male artist, Kanye West, whose recent political pronouncements have frustrated many fans. ìBetween ëAtlantaí and his music, Gloverís work could have an antiseptic quality, cleansing us of Kanyeís descent into anti-blackness and celebratory idiocy,î Young observes. ìBut at the very least, this comparison fails because it reduces Gloverís work to that of a palate cleanser. And also implied is that only one of these types of men can exist concurrently.î ëThe Filmmaker of the Year Hasnít Even Made a Feature Film Yetí [The Ringer] Adam Nayman turns his attention to the director of ìThis Is America,î Hiro Murai, who got his start making music videos and has also directed many standout episodes of ìAtlantaî and HBOís recent critical favorite ìBarry.î As Nayman sees it, ìThe power of Muraiís aesthetic is bound up in the balance between the cameraís visual overstatement and its subjectsí deadpan dismissal.î"
158,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,14:50:04,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/china-korea-america-kim.html,What Is Kim Jong-unís Game?,North Korea is making overtures to South Korea to get closer to America and keep China in check.,Jean-Pierre Cabestan,Opinion,Domestic Politics,"North Korea, Kim Jong-un, US Foreign Policy, Nuclear weapon, Military, Arms control, Donald Trump, Moon Jae-in, Asia, China, South Korea","HONG KONG ó The immediate causes of the recent diplomatic breakthrough on the Korean Peninsula are well known: stronger international sanctions against North Korea, approved by even China and Russia, and President Trumpís bellicose response to the recent intensification of nuclear and missile tests under Kim Jong-un, North Koreaís leader since 2011. But a more fundamental driver is being overlooked: Chinaís growing ambition to dominate East Asia. Mr. Kimís apparent move to reconcile with his South Korean counterpart, President Moon Jae-in, is above all a gambit to get closer to America to keep China in check. He hopes to reduce North Koreaís overarching economic dependence on China and curb Beijingís aspirations to control the future of the Korean Peninsula. The regimeís survival and security have long been the Kim familyís top priority, with political independence not far behind; those are the prime reasons it has sought to develop North Koreaís nuclear weapons and long-range missile capability. That purpose has also been served by political purges, notably the killing in late 2013 of Mr. Kimís uncle Jang Song-thaek, who was suspected of entertaining especially close relations with China, and in early 2017 of Mr. Kimís half brother Kim Jong-nam, another Beijing protÈgÈ and once an heir apparent to Kim Jong-il, the countryís previous leader and Mr. Kimís father. Now that these pressing existential objectives seem to have been satisfied, economic development has become the crux of the regimeís long-term stability. It is no coincidence, for example, that last month the Workersí Party of Korea abruptly decided to abandon its well-established policy of byungjin ó the simultaneous advancement of the countryís military, particularly its nuclear program, and its economy ó to refocus entirely on economic development. But how best to do that? With more than 90 percent of North Koreaís trade already dependent on China, moving even closer to Beijing would risk turning North Korea into an appendage or tributary state ó a dream for some Chinese nationalists but the nightmare of almost every North Korean. Integrating with South Korea would undermine the primacy of the Kim family in the North. In theory, Russia could help reduce North Koreaís dependence on China for oil and gas, but little else. So Mr. Kimís best option to boost the North Korean economy is to diversify its partnerships and open up to the West and Japan. Moving the country closer to the United States and further from China is also sound strategy from a security point of view. China may not openly threaten North Koreaís independence, but its ambition to better control its near abroad ó in Southeast Asia, around the South China Sea, through its One Belt, One Road initiative ó can only breed serious suspicions in Pyongyang. (There seems to have been no talk of reactivating the old Sino-North Korean alliance or the two countriesí long-forgotten mutual defense treaty.) Mr. Kimís overture to Mr. Trump to fend off China today is not unlike Maoís reaching out to President Richard Nixon to hold back the Soviet threat in the early 1970s. This development, however implausible or sudden it may seem, should come as no surprise, especially in a part of the world where state leaders tend to be realists in international affairs. And Mr. Kim may be the most realist of them all. None of this is to say that China will soon be ìsidelined,î as some have speculated. Beijing will always be part of the picture, and sometimes part of the problem. The point is simply that Chinaís neighbors are repositioning themselves as it becomes stronger and tries to establish hierarchical or clientelist relations with them. Some, like Cambodia and Laos, comply. Others, like Vietnam and Singapore, try to push back or at least rebalance. North Korea, too, must recalibrate and hedge. It does so from a special posture, of course, because of its nuclear program and diplomatic isolation ó and because of many remaining uncertainties about its intentions, including over a matter as fundamental as what it means by ìdenuclearization.î Still, Mr. Kimís unexpected offer to meet President Trump and Mr. Trumpís quick acceptance suggest that both leaders see in this moment an opportunity for some measure of dÈtente. About that much at least they are correct. Lifting sanctions, normalizing relations, starting to trade ó these things may not materialize soon, or ever. But the strategic landscape on the Korean Peninsula already has changed, and it has changed in favor of America and its allies. Mr. Kimís sudden and unannounced meeting with Mr. Xi in Beijing recently was, more than anything, a remarkable diplomatic show, mainly designed to allow China to save face. During the five years that he has been in power, Mr. Xi has seemed to largely ignore Mr. Kim; he may now regret that approach. As Chinaís power has risen, Americaís has declined, persuading North Korea to move closer to the United States and seek from it security guarantees. Skeptics will doubt that North Korea, given its ideology, can really move in this direction; optimists may now see the reunification of the Korean Peninsula on the horizon. I think that North Koreaís one-party system will remain in place for a long while and that in the meantime the countryís human rights situation will continue to be dire. Nor will improved relations between the two Koreas, or even the conclusion of a peace treaty, lead to any kind of reunification. Any such thing would be suicidal for Pyongyang and too costly for Seoul. Yet I also think that this moment is indeed a rare opportunity for both America and Americaís allies to improve relations with North Korea ó and work with it to establish a new balance of power in Northeast Asia that can offset Chinaís ambition to dominate the region and better serve the interests of the West."

The officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 53, was arrested by F.B.I. agents in January after federal prosecutors accused him of illegally possessing classified information. But the new charge reflected a willingness of prosecutors to disclose sensitive details they might have been reluctant to acknowledge publicly. According to prosecutors, two Chinese intelligence officers approached Mr. Lee in April 2010 and offered to pay him for information. The intelligence officers ìprovided Lee with a series of email addresses so that he could communicate covertly with them,î court papers said, and he received instructions from Chinese intelligence officers until at least 2011. ìI canít comment on the indictment because the government hasnít filed anything but a press release,î Mr. Leeís lawyer, Edward MacMahon, said on Tuesday. Mr. Lee was at the center of an intensive F.B.I. and C.I.A. investigation into how the Chinese determined the identities of agency informants. The dismantling of the C.I.A.ís spy network in China was one of the worst American intelligence failures in years. Mr. Lee joined the C.I.A. in 1994 and left in 2007, moving his family to Hong Kong. According to court documents, the F.B.I. lured Mr. Lee back to the United States in 2012 as part of a sensitive intelligence operation. While he was in Virginia and Hawaii, agents secretly searched his belongings and found a pair of notebooks containing sensitive details about C.I.A. operations and the identities of undercover officers and informants. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Lee five times but never directly asked him whether he had worked for the Chinese government. Investigators let Mr. Lee leave the country in 2013 in hopes of gathering more evidence and proving he had committed espionage. Prosecutors said Mr. Lee made ìunexplained cash deposits, and repeatedly lied to the U.S. government during voluntary interviews when asked about travel to China and his actions overseas.î"

Carson","Civil rights advocates sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over enforcement of the 50-year-old Fair Housing Act, part of an effort to prevent discrimination in the allocation of funds for Gulf Coast hurricane housing and infrastructure reconstruction. A coalition of national and Texas-based housing groups filed suit in United States District Court in Washington to reinstate an Obama-era rule that required localities receiving federal development funding to submit plans detailing their efforts to end segregation based on race, income, ethnicity or physical disability. Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, suspended the rule, known as the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing provision, this year over concerns that it put too heavy a burden on local governments that would have to allocate resources to produce the plans. While Mr. Carson favors slowing down enforcement of the antisegregation initiative and limiting its scope, the impetus for doing away with the rule comes from White House officials, according to three people with knowledge of the situation. Mr. Carson, skeptical that the department can prevail in the case, has authorized his staff to create an alternative plan, which might include a new round of hearings into how to improve the rule, according to one of the officials. The advocates filing the lawsuit argue that Mr. Carsonís actions violated the 1968 Housing Act, a law that was pressed by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. shortly before his assassination. The suit claims that Mr. Carson is leaving HUD without a system to prevent a pattern of discrimination in the allocation of $28 billion in disaster relief funding after a succession of natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey, last year. The fight centers on an affirmative fair housing rule put in place in 2015 after two years of study and public hearings. At the time, Julian Castro, Mr. Carsonís predecessor as HUD secretary, said the regulation would ìprovide all Americans with access to safe, affordable housing in communities that are rich with opportunity.î But housing advocates say the administration has not followed through with ensuring equitable treatment in housing, and they are concerned that HUD may discriminate against vulnerable populations when awarding funds to reconstruct areas damaged by natural disasters. Lisa Rice, the president of the National Fair Housing Alliance, one of the groups bringing the suit, said the litigation was intended to prevent racial bias in the reconstruction of housing, drainage systems and other infrastructure. The group wants to ensure that black, Hispanic and low-income residents of Houston and Corpus Christi are not put at risk in the event of another natural disaster. ìThis is the fight Dr. King envisioned, even 50 years later,î Ms. Rice said. Madison Sloan, the director of Texas Appleseedís Disaster Recovery & Fair Housing Project, another plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the suit was about not leaving people behind. ìWe know that disasters have a disparate impact on the most vulnerable populations, especially communities of color,î she said. ìHistorically, segregation has forced these communities into the areas most vulnerable to natural disasters. We have to make sure we are rebuilding in a way that remedies, rather than perpetuates, these inequalities.î A HUD spokesman did not return a call for comment. Mr. Carson has said he delayed the rule to give localities more time to comply. But his previous comments suggest a lack of affinity for the provision. In a 2015 editorial in the conservative Washington Times, Mr. Carson criticized the effort in sweeping ideological terms, calling it ìsocial engineering,î and predicted that its enforcement would repeat ìthe failure of school busingî in the 1970s. Mr. Carson, during testimony last month before congressional committees, said he intended to comply with other department regulations requiring that the majority of disaster relief funding be directed to those most in need. But he gave little ground on the Obama-era provision when he met with fair housing advocates late last month by rejecting their calls to reinstate the rule. Some department officials said Mr. Carsonís efforts at HUD so far include slowing enforcement actions and investigations of some fair housing violations. Housing segregation has long been an issue for HUD and has landed previous secretaries in the cross hairs. George Romney, the first HUD secretary, clashed with President Richard M. Nixon when he tried to withhold federal funding for sewer, highway, water and infrastructure projects in areas that encouraged segregation. Mr. Nixon blocked the program, known as ìOpen Communities.î Mr. Romney, the father of Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate and current Utah Senate candidate, forged ahead with the plan and was eventually ejected from the cabinet."

In a vote of 234 to 175, the House nullified 2013 guidance issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau aimed at preventing auto lenders from charging minorities higher fees when taking out car loans. The move followed a similar vote last month by the Senate to void the antidiscrimination guidance and the resolution to strike down the rule will now go to President Trump, who is expected to sign off on it. Both the Senate and House voided the consumer rule using the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that gives Congress the power to expunge rules that were created by government agencies. The auto-lending guidance has divided lawmakers along party lines, with Democrats arguing that the policy protected consumers from unfair discrimination and Republicans making the case that it was an example of overreach by the consumer bureau that was squeezing the lending industry. Eleven House Democrats supported the measure on Tuesday. Consumer advocates warned that doing away with antidiscrimination protections would drive up fees for those seeking auto loans and said that other consumer protections could soon be targeted. ìCompanies will put millions of people into more expensive car loans simply because of the color of their skin,î said Rion Dennis, an advocate of financial overhaul at Americans for Financial Reform. ìBy using the Congressional Review Act to wipe out straightforward regulatory guidance, the congressional majority has also opened the door to challenging longstanding efforts to protect workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.î The Center for Responsible Lending analyzed loan level data in 2011 and found that black and Latino consumers were receiving higher numbers of interest rate markups on their car loans than white consumers. The bureau issued guidance in 2013 urging auto lenders to curb discriminatory lending practices and used that guidance to justify lawsuits that they brought against auto finance companies. On Tuesday, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that the consumer bureau used faulty methodology when producing an analysis to justify its auto-lending rule. ìThey claimed that somehow there was unconscious discrimination,î Mr. Hensarling said. ìThey made it up. They had no data.î Last year, the Government Accountability Office determined that the bureauís guidance was technically a rule, a decision that gave Congress authority to use the Congressional Review Act to kill it. While several rules developed toward the end of the Obama administration have been nullified by this Congress, rescinding the auto financing rule was considered unusual since it is an older provision that has been in place for years. Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned on Tuesday that Republicans were opening a Pandoraís box that could herald the repeal of rules that have been in place for years, potentially harming consumers in a variety of ways. She pushed back against the suggestion that the consumer bureau rule relied upon bad data and said killing it would hurt minorities. ìThis is about discrimination,î Ms. Waters said. Republicans and Democrats have long been at odds over the mandate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Republicans have long derided the agency for overstepping its bounds and last year, Mr. Trump installed Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to run the bureau on an interim basis. Since then, Mr. Mulvaney has worked hard to scale back its ambitions and freeze much of its enforcement activities. While lawmakers continue to disagree over portions of the Trump administrationís regulatory agenda, Republicans and Democrats are nearing agreement on the first significant bipartisan bill to alter the Dodd-Frank Act. House Republicans, who had been pushing for a more expansive financial overhaul bill that would eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and make other sweeping changes, appear ready to accept the more limited Senate bill that passed this year. That bill would largely ease regulations that largely apply to community banks. Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, said on Tuesday that he had reached an agreement with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to move forward with a vote on the Dodd-Frank bill in the House. He said that the House would also send to the Senate a package of other pieces of financial overhaul legislation that the House has been working on that they believe would add to that bill. Additional pieces of legislation that stray too far from what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis are unlikely to pass in the Senate, where Republicans have a very slim majority. Mr. Ryan did not indicate when he planned to hold a vote, but lawmakers and administration officials have signaled that it could be in the coming weeks."

Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, of physical assault this week, he suggested that they were describing consensual sexual encounters. The allegations against him were new. That defense was not. Those accused of committing violence against their partners often seek to dismiss those claims, sometimes by arguing that the partners were willing participants in sexual role playing or ìrough sex.î Hereís a look at the legal and other issues raised by such claims. In a written statement to The New Yorker, included in the article revealing the choking and slapping allegations against him, Mr. Schneiderman denied committing any assault. ìIn the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity,î he wrote. ìI have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.î Many men before him have said the same when confronted by such accusations. In 2014, for example, several women accused Jian Ghomeshi, a well-known Canadian musician and former radio host, of biting, punching, choking and smothering. In response, he described the activities on Facebook as consensual ó ìa mild form of ëFifty Shades of Grey,íî he wrote. (He was ultimately acquitted of sexual assault.) There is a bright line between pain caused by unwanted sexual or domestic violence and pain that can come during some kinds of consensual sexual activity among willing participants. ìIf itís not consensual, then itís not ërough sex.í Itís abuse,î said Susan Wright, the founder of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, an advocacy organization for a diverse range of sexualities and sexual preferences. Consent should be given early and often, she said. Limits, risks and how to stop sexual activity should be discussed beforehand. And assumptions should never be made. ìI know some people think itís not sexy or spontaneous to actually talk about sex before you have it,î she said. ìTheyíre absolutely wrong, because itís the best foreplay in the world to talk about the things that turn you on and find out what things turn the other person on.î Even with consent, if sexual activity causes serious harm, it crosses the line to assault, she said. In seeking to explain away their crimes, violent perpetrators have long claimed that victims ìasked for it.î But the ìrough sex defenseî gained notoriety under that name after being used in a high-profile trial in New York in the 1980s. The trial revolved around the death by strangling of Jennifer Dawn Levin in the summer of 1986. The night before a bicyclist found her body behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Ms. Levin had met up with Robert E. Chambers Jr. at Dorrianís Red Hand, a bar on the Upper East Side. The pair left the bar together at about 4:30 a.m. before walking to Central Park. Mr. Chambers was immediately suspected in her death and soon became known in the tabloid newspapers of the day as the ìPreppy Killer.î Until pleading guilty to manslaughter in 1988, he had long insisted that the death was an accident: He said that he had suffocated Ms. Levin by mistake after she hurt him during consensual sex. The New York Daily News highlighted his defense in the front-page headline the following day: ìGirlís slaying suspect: SEX PLAY ëGOT ROUGH.íî The trial turned into a media sensation. In the end, Mr. Chambers spent more than a decade in prison. Two of the women told The New Yorker that Mr. Schneiderman had choked them. Choking is one of the most common forms of domestic violence, according to experts, and it can predict more serious violence to come. According to one often-cited statistic, those who have been choked by an intimate partner are about seven times as likely to be killed by an intimate partner. Jarringly in retrospect, when Mr. Schneiderman was a state senator from Manhattan in 2010, he introduced a bill to make intentional choking to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. The measure was welcomed by law enforcement officials, and it is now New York state law."

Vance Jr., saying he wanted to avoid ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even the whiff or perception of conflict.‚<U+0080>ù",Jan Ransom,New York,US,"Special prosecutor, Rape, District attorney, Attorney general, Domestic violence, Andrew Cuomo, Eric T Schneiderman, Cyrus R Vance Jr","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo asked Tuesday night that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate allegations that Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman assaulted four women he was romantically involved with over several years, taking the inquiry away from the Manhattan district attorney. Hours after The New Yorker reported on Monday that they had accused Mr. Schneiderman of assault, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., announced that his office would investigate the allegations, raising the possibility that criminal charges would accompany Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political fall from grace. But by early Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo had raised questions about Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to be impartial, saying he wanted ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an investigation by an independent district attorney‚<U+0080>ù who did not have ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a whiff of conflict.‚<U+0080>ù And by nightfall, he had written a letter ordering the Nassau County district attorney, Madeline Singas, be appointed to investigate ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any and all matters‚<U+0080>ù related to Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mistreatment of his former romantic partners. In his letter, Mr. Cuomo said Ms. Singas would have the power to take over the case from the Manhattan district attorney. He said Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s previous investigation of Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s handling of a 2015 investigation into Harvey Weinstein created ‚<U+0080><U+009C>at a minimum the appearance of a conflict of interest, ‚<U+0080>ù and that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the victims deserved nothing less‚<U+0080>ù than ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an unbiased investigation.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement Mr. Vance fired back at the governor on Tuesday night, saying in a letter that he objected to the decision to appoint a special prosecutor. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Put simply, no prosecutors are better equipped to investigate and pursue such cases in Manhattan than those in my office, ‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. He also said governor himself had created the conflict of interest when he ordered the attorney general to conduct the review of the Weinstein case, a move Mr. Vance called an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unwarranted intrusion by an elected executive into a charging decision by an independent prosecutor.‚<U+0080>ù He further noted that because Mr. Schneiderman was no longer the attorney general, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the purported conflict no longer exists.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman, who resigned soon after the story broke, on Tuesday retained Isabelle Kirshner, a well-known defense lawyer with the firm Clayman & Rosenberg, to represent him. If the allegations are proven true, he could face a host of criminal charges, including assault, harassment, forcible touching, strangulation and related offenses, former prosecutors and legal experts said. Prosecutors will also have to determine whether Mr. Schneiderman used government resources to cover up his actions or whether the threats he made were under color of law. Still, legal experts say prosecutors will face several legal and political hurdles in investigating the case. Two of the women interviewed, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, said Mr. Schneiderman choked and repeatedly hit them. Both women said they sought medical treatment. Mr. Schneiderman also threatened to kill them if they broke up with him, they said, and he told one woman he could have her followed and her phones tapped. All four women who spoke to the magazine said that they had been romantically involved with Mr. Schneiderman, but that the violence was not consensual. Mr. Cuomo made it clear on Tuesday he wanted someone other than Mr. Vance to investigate the allegations. In March, Mr. Cuomo had directed Mr. Schneiderman to review how the Manhattan district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and the New York Police Department handle sexual assault complaints, including a 2015 sexual assault allegation against Mr. Weinstein. At the time, Mr. Vance had said that there was not enough evidence to prosecute, even though Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accuser, Ambra Battilana, an Italian model, had provided police with a recording of him apologizing in response to a question about why he had groped her breasts Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to make sure the district attorneys have no conflicts whatsoever with the attorney general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office, either institutionally or personally, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Cuomo said during an unrelated news conference on Tuesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very important that the district attorney or attorneys that do the investigation have not even the whiff or perception of conflict, because the statement we need to make is you come forward, you show the bravery to come forward, you will be heard, justice will be done.‚<U+0080>ù In a letter to the acting attorney general, Mr. Cuomo said Ms. Singas would not only investigate the allegations in The New Yorker article but would also look into whether the attorney general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s staff and office resources were used to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>facilitate alleged abusive liaisons.‚<U+0080>ù Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Singas was the former head of the special victims bureau in the Nassau County district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office before she was elected to lead the office in 2015. The case involving Mr. Schneiderman would normally fall under at least two jurisdictions: One woman said she was physically assaulted in Mr. Schneiderman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Upper West Side home in Manhattan, and another woman said she was assaulted at a place he was staying in the Hamptons in Suffolk County. Sheila Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Suffolk County district attorney, said the office was investigating the allegation. However, if the governor appointed a special prosecutor, Ms. Kelly said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we would fully support that in any way we could.‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Singas will face obstacles. For starters, she must convince the women to testify. Then, some of the allegations may be too old to prosecute because the statute of limitations for a misdemeanor is two years, and for a felony five years. The alleged abuse occurred between 2013 and 2017. Mr. Schneiderman could face a felony charge for some of his behavior, depending on how severe the assaults were and if they involved strangulation, legal experts said. (Ironically, Mr. Schneiderman, who was a New York State senator for 12 years, crafted a law that made life-threatening strangulation a crime and the obstruction of breathing a crime punishable by up to a year in jail.) The women did not file police reports at the time of the alleged incidents, but any medical records and photos they have could prove useful toward an investigation, though it would not be necessary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This could be a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>he said, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+0099> but there are a lot of ‚<U+0080><U+0098>she saids, ‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù said Ellen Yaroshefsky, a Hofstra University law professor. Advertisement Evan Krutoy, a former Manhattan prosecutor who now focuses on internal sexual harassment investigations for companies, said the allegations reported by the magazine do not appear to amount to more than misdemeanor conduct and strangulation in the second degree. That means some may be too old to prosecute. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>To prove a slap as a felony is almost impossible, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There would need to have been a weapon involved or extreme injury for a greater charge.‚<U+0080>ù Eugene J. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Donnell, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the case will ‚<U+0080><U+009C>obviously revolve around what the victims say and their accounting of what happened.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Depending on what the victims say will determine the kind of case and whether it will be relatively insignificant charges or profoundly life altering charges, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Donnell said that even if the case involving Mr. Weinstein were not under review, the nature of the relationship between any Manhattan district attorney and the New York attorney general might present a conflict of interest. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Manhattan is an outsize prosecutor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and conceivably others don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have much to do with Schneiderman, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re talking about building confidence in the system and making sure the door is fully open to victims and avoiding the appearance of impropriety, then it is better for the Manhattan district attorney to step aside.‚<U+0080>ù Follow Jan Ransom on Twitter: @Jan_Ransom.

Story collections from novelists sometimes give readers the sense that the author has dug up several half-finished, long-abandoned works from graduate school, dusted them off, revived them, then cauterized them with an ending. This is not the case in ìYou Think It, Iíll Say It,î a new book of short fiction by Curtis Sittenfeld; but as if to dispatch even the possibility of that impression, the first story, ìGender Studies,î is placed squarely in the context of the most recent presidential election. ìThereís no way Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,î Nell, an academic, tells a Kansas City cabdriver who is dropping her at her hotel. That misguided assumption turns out to be the first of many she makes over the course of the evening she ultimately spends with the driver: It takes longer than it should for her to realize she has both been misled and done some misleading of her own. Nell is sympathetic, insomuch as she is at least aware of her own smugness (which, at its worst, takes the form of bad faith). The characters in Sittenfeldís novels are often redeemed by their self-criticism; however flawed their behavior, they have the good sense to be riddled with self-doubt about it. Her female characters in particular examine, worry over and question their own dispositions. ìAnd underneath all the decorum, isnít most everyone judgmental and disappointed?î wonders Hannah Gravener, the judgmental and disappointed narrator of ìThe Man of My Dreams.î ìOr is it only certain people, and can she choose not to be one of them ó can she choose this without also, like her mother, just giving in?î Hannah is the kind of person who frets, while taking in the grandeur of Alaska, about the way that ìthoughts about how small you are always feel small themselves.î A psychic young mother who narrates Sittenfeldís ìSisterlandî is uncomfortable with her powers, as if they were mostly a crippling embarrassment. In ìPrep,î Sittenfeldís blockbuster debut, she portrayed a middle-class young woman attending an elite boarding school, someone self-conscious about being self-conscious. Even the lovely but traumatized Alice Lindgren, a stand-in for Laura Bush in her novel ìAmerican Wife,î observes with fascination her husband and his brotherís crass bathroom humor, which betrays the privileged swagger of the blissfully oblivious. Especially in her earlier work, Sittenfeldís young women do not exactly resent the relative ease with which others ó the beautiful, or the moneyed, or the innately, effortlessly good ó seem to navigate the world; they study their ways, quixotically, tormented by those qualities or behaviors they donít understand. This collection is Sittenfeldís sixth book; the adolescents of her earlier work have grown up, with adulthood yielding decidedly mixed results. In ìThe World Has Many Butterflies,î that type of young woman ó the kind who cracks wise from a crouched position ó is now a suburban Houston housewife who has fallen into a world of aspirational child rearing. Without an appreciative audience for the mostly damning asides of her internal monologues, she falls for the first man who seems attuned to them, confusing an open ear with erotic interest: ìShe was simultaneously shocked by the conversation, shocked to be having it with a man, shocked by its effortlessness, and not surprised at all; it was as if sheíd been waiting to be recognized, as if sheíd never sung in public, then someone had handed her a microphone and sheíd opened her mouth and released a full-throated vibrato.î In this collection, Sittenfeld occasionally swerves from the female point of view to the male who, elsewhere in her fiction, is usually the object of so much obsessive rumination. In ìDo-Over,î following Trumpís election, a divorced financier resolves to apologize to an old female friend about a moment of sexism that gave him an unfair advantage over her in a student election back at boarding school. He is surprised when the woman, who had a crush on him as a teenager, does not forgive his late-to-the-game moral awakening. Over the course of a dinner out, she turns so hostile it is almost exhilarating, the good girl, the brainy girl, for once saying exactly what she thinks. (The story, like the first in the collection, summons the spirit of Lorrie Mooreís perfect ìYouíre Ugly, Too.î) ìIsnít it weird how I was tormented as a teenager by a person who grew up into a banker who talks incessantly about his Fitbit?î she asks her former classmate, who is mild, earnest and no longer smoking hot. ìDid I offend you?ÖI didnít mean to. I was trying to be factual.î In the lives of Sittenfeldís characters, the lusts and disappointments of youth loom large well into middle age, as insistent as a gang of loud, showy teenagers taking up all the oxygen in the room. A married woman is obsessed with an ex-girlfriend from summer camp who became a wholesome megabrand known as ìThe Prairie Wifeî (also the name of the story); in ìA Regular Couple,î a famous defense attorney who has just married is plagued by an encounter with the popular girl from her high school, who is also honeymooning at the same resort. Some of the stories grant the possibility that the characters have grown in the intervening years, and grown softer, more generous; others suggest, more spikily, that there is no hope of leaving behind what was painful, or of recovering what was good. These storytellers are, for the most part, a privileged, educated lot. Their trials, in the grand scheme of things, are manageable enough that they allow easily for comedy, which Sittenfeld is a pro at delivering in the details (the smug academicís cat is named Converse, ìnot for the shoe but for the political scientistî). But Sittenfeld doesnít shy away from poking at the soft spots of a personís psyche, the painful longings for something exquisite to cut through the ennui of even the most comfortable lives. In ìPlausible Deniability,î an eligible man who canít seem to form meaningful attachments grows reliant on daily emails from a woman conveying her thoughts on classical music: ìBeing in touch with her offered a cushioning to my days, an antidote to the tedium and indignity of being a person, the lack of accountability of my adulthood.î She thinks they are having an emotional affair; he tells himself it is much less. The women of ìYou Think It, Iíll Say Itî are, as a group, a demanding breed. They often assume the worst in their imagined adversaries. Sometimes they are wrong, but they are right about just enough (and funny enough) that we forgive them. And, because they know they need absolution for their own worst motives, we forgive those, too."

But Comcast is weighing a hostile bid that could upend Disneyís deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox.",Brooks Barnes,Business Day,Business,"Movies, TV, Walt Disney, Comcast,21st Century Fox, Robert A Iger, Black Panther,","LOS ANGELES ó The Walt Disney Company reported its strongest quarterly results in two years on Tuesday, streaking past Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue growth thanks in large part to the success of ìBlack Panther.î But that strong performance was shadowed by maneuvering by Comcast to upend Disneyís pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets. Robert A. Iger, Disneyís chief executive, struck a $52.4 billion all-stock deal in December to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch. In a securities filing last month, Fox disclosed that its board had spurned a competing bid from Comcast that was 16 percent higher on a per-share basis because of antitrust concerns and the belief that Disney shares would be more valuable over the long haul. But Comcast ó the same Comcast that tried to swallow Disney in 2004, an attempt Disney fought off but has never forgotten ó is now weighing a hostile bid for the Fox businesses. Over the past week, Comcast has met with investment banks to line up roughly $60 billion in financing to mount an all-cash push for Mr. Murdochís entertainment empire, according to two people briefed on the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private process. Comcast declined to comment. Mr. Iger, speaking on a conference call with analysts after Disney reported a 23 percent increase in quarterly profit, presented the deal as a fait accompli. ìWe are confident that the assets that we are in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved,î he said, referring to Disneyís recent reorganization. He never mentioned Comcast during the call, and pre-empted any analyst queries about 21st Century Fox. ìWe are still deep in the regulatory process so I canít share any more information or engage in further speculation about the deal, except to say that we strongly believe in the value of those assets,î he said. Mr. Igerís confidence may stem from Wall Streetís reaction to Comcastís jockeying. Its meetings with bankers, first reported by Reuters on Monday, prompted a 5.6 percent drop in Comcast shares. The stock has fallen 11 percent since late April, when speculation about a possible hostile bid by Comcast first began to swirl. Many analysts have recoiled at such a bid, which could leave Comcast with more than $170 billion in debt ó a sum that would make it one of the largest corporate debtholders in American history. ìWe do not believe Comcast needs another media asset,î Gregory Williams, a Cowen and Company analyst, wrote in a research note. But at least one analyst, Richard Greenfield of BTIG Research, a persistent Disney critic, cheered on Comcast on Tuesday. ìDear Rupert: Listen to Brian in the Battle for Fox,î he wrote, referring to Comcastís chief executive, Brian Roberts. At the very least, the possibility of a Comcast bid seemed to hang over Disney shares, which edged slightly down despite the strong quarterly report. ìThe stock is going to be pretty sideways until this gets resolved,î said Robin Diedrich, an analyst at Edward Jones. Comcast has indicated that a run at 21st Century Fox would depend on the outcome of the pending merger by AT&T and Time Warner. Antitrust regulators have been battling that corporate marriage in court; arguments have now concluded and a decision is expected by June 12. Separately, Comcast started a bidding war with Mr. Murdoch in April for control of Sky, a European pay-television provider. Mr. Murdoch already owns a slice of the company and has agreed to sell to Disney as part of the 21st Century Fox trove. For the quarter, Disney reported net income of $2.94 billion, or $1.95 per share, an increase from $2.39 billion or $1.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected per-share profit of $1.69. Disneyís revenue totaled $14.55 billion, a 9 percent increase; analysts expected $14.08 billion. The strong results for the second fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, were driven by Walt Disney Studios, where operating income soared 29 percent, to $847 million. The biggest contributor was Ryan Cooglerís ìBlack Panther,î which has collected $1.34 billion worldwide since its record-breaking February release. Sales of ìStar Wars: The Last Jediî on DVD and video-on-demand services also helped. But the quarter also served as a reminder of how volatile the movie business can be ó even for Disney, which has dominated Hollywood in recent years. Ava DuVernayís ìA Wrinkle in Time,î released by Disney on March 9, was a financial debacle, costing at least $200 million to make and market and taking in just $127 million worldwide. After theater owners get their cut, Disney will be left with roughly $60 million. ìA Wrinkle in Timeî performed so poorly overseas that Disney decided not to release it in some countries, although DVD sales, TV reruns and themed merchandise could ultimately generate another $30 million or so. But Disneyís theme park division had another sizzling quarter. Operating income jumped 27 percent, to $954 million. Walt Disney World in Florida benefited from higher ticket prices and hotel room rates; a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday helped increase attendance by 5 percent. Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland also had improved results. Disneyís biggest unit, Media Networks, which includes ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel, reported revenue of $6.14 billion, a 3 percent increase. But operating profit declined 6 percent, to $2.08 billion, because of higher costs ó notably spending on unprofitable streaming services like ESPN+ and Hulu ó and subscriber declines at ESPN. Ongoing struggles at Freeform, a channel aimed at young adults, also dented the results. ESPN+ was introduced in the quarter and represents one of the ways that Mr. Iger is trying to lessen the Magic Kingdomís reliance on the atrophying cable television business. The app-based service costs $5 a month and includes thousands of sporting events not shown on television, along with exclusive programming like the ì30 for 30î sports documentaries and a basketball analysis show hosted by the former Lakers star Kobe Bryant. Mr. Iger said he was ìvery encouragedî by the early response to ESPN+ but declined to provide subscriber numbers. ìMost importantly, the technology is working,î he said. ìWeíre going to continue to improve it.î Earlier on Tuesday, Disney added live mixed martial arts matches to the ESPN+ portfolio under a deal with U.F.C. Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disneyís international and direct-to-consumer division, cited U.F.C.ís ìenthusiastic, growing fan baseî in announcing the multiyear deal, which analysts estimated would cost Disney roughly $150 million a year."

Miller,T Magazine,Domestic Politics,"Iraq War,2000s Decade, Dashboard Confessional, Zach Braff, George W Bush","To be a teenager during George W. Bush‚<U+0080><U+0099>s invasion of Iraq was to spend a significant amount of time actively fantasizing about the president facing a war crimes tribunal at The Hague. It was a period marked by meaningless deaths and falsehoods (namely that Iraq had a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction). And yet, in 2018, a wistful reminiscence of the W. Bush years has taken hold. Network television has revived queasily irrelevant shows like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Will & Grace.‚<U+0080>ù An actress from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sex and the City‚<U+0080>ù is making a serious bid for governor of New York. And a man who hosted the second most popular reality television program of 2004 is now president. How did this happen? Many of the memorable touchstones of the early Bush years might be defined as emo, which began as a musical style in the mid-‚<U+0080><U+0099>80s born from the hardcore punk scene in Washington, D.C., and reached its commercial peak in the early 2000s, coming to redefine all aspects of (white) late capitalism through a lens of narcissism, privilege, misogyny and self-pity. On the teen soap opera ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The O.C., ‚<U+0080>ù which debuted in the summer of 2003, Seth Cohen made Hollywood safe for sad nerds as he debated which of two too-good-for-him girls he should date. A mopey Zach Braff fell in love with Natalie Portman and shed a single tear in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Garden State.‚<U+0080>ù On the radio, the resident troubadour was Bright Eyes‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Conor Oberst, who sang of military combat and relationships with a similar gravity: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We made love on the living room floor / with the noise in the background from a televised war.‚<U+0080>ù Considering that we now live in a world where the threat of destruction is not quite as remote as it was in 2003, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s little wonder that we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve become nostalgic for such inconsequential unhappiness. The early 2000s sad-sack band Dashboard Confessional (sample song title: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Sharp Hint of New Tears‚<U+0080>ù) just released a new album. Braff is starring in a new sitcom. A musical version of the 2004 film ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mean Girls‚<U+0080>ù recently opened on Broadway, while Greta Gerwig‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 2002-set ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lady Bird, ‚<U+0080>ù another piece of art about a moody adolescent, brilliantly recreated the characterless look of the early aughts, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the age of throwaway fashion, ‚<U+0080>ù as the film‚<U+0080><U+0099>s costume designer has called it. On Inauguration Day in 2017, George W.

Emo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s general argument was that the proper response to futility was not to fight against it or even to wallow in existential longing but instead to deploy an excessive, almost comical level of self-absorption.

Schneiderman, seemed staid and somewhat standoffish: a teetotaler who favored coffee shops over bars, liked yoga and health food and preferred high-minded intellectual and legal debate to the hand-to-hand combat of New Yorkís political arena. But that carefully cultivated image of a caring, progressive Renaissance man came crashing down on Monday night after the publication of an expose by The New Yorker, detailing allegations of a sordid and stomach-turning double life, including Mr. Schneidermanís physical and psychological abuse of four women with whom he had been romantically involved. The attorney generalís behavior, the article said, had been exacerbated by alcohol abuse and punctuated by insults of the very liberal voters and activists who had held him up as a champion willing to deliver a fearless counterpunch to President Trump. The article ricocheted around the New York and national political scene at a quarkís pace, leading to nearly immediate calls for Mr. Schneidermanís resignation from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, and other officials, and his almost-as-speedy, almost-grudging acceptance of his political fate. ìWhile these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the officeís work at this critical time,î Mr. Schneiderman said, in a statement released just before 10 p.m. on Monday. He gave himself one day to clear out his desk though he was not seen at his office in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday. Television cameras were positioned outside, as they were near his apartment on the Upper West Side, even as the new acting attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, was sworn in. Mr. Schneiderman has denied assaulting anyone or engaging in nonconsensual sex. The resignation brought to an abrupt end his two terms in office and two decades in public service, marked with the kind of accomplishments that make Democratic leaders salivate, including battling Mr. Trump, whom he had sued successfully over fraud involving Trump University ó winning $25 million shortly after the 2016 election ó and more recently targeting serial sexual abusers like Harvey Weinstein, suing the Hollywood mogul and firmly embracing the #MeToo movement. That hypocrisy ó professing to defend women while secretly, according to The New Yorker article, beating them ó seemed particularly rank. ìItís so devastating on so many levels because he did great things in office, as a state senator, as attorney general,î said Linda Rosenthal, a Democratic assemblywoman from the Upper West Side, who has known Mr. Schneiderman since before his political career began. ìYet behind the scenes, he treated women like garbage.î Mr. Schneiderman, 63, had widely been considered a future contender for governor in New York, a solidly blue state where Mr. Cuomo is also said to harbor higher ambitions. Mr. Schneidermanís campaign accounts were substantial, with more than $8.5 million in the bank, an increasingly high profile burnished by his long battles with Mr. Trump and appearances on national talk shows. The shock of the allegations was shared inside the attorney generalís office itself, which has a work force of about 1,800 people, including 700 lawyers. ìThere were no allegations against him made in the office,î said Amy Spitanick, a spokeswoman for the attorney general. ìAnd we were not aware of any allegations until we got press calls.î Those calls apparently began to land on Monday morning, after several weeks of rumors ó in Albany and elsewhere ó about a possible investigation into Mr. Schneidermanís personal life and behavior. The graphic details of the womenís stories seemed even more stark considering the enlightened-man elements of his biography and his standing on the Upper West Side, the cityís traditional bastion of its most liberal-minded voters. A campaign advertisement from his successful run for attorney general in 2010, when he was a state senator, depicted him as constantly interrupted by complimentary constituents on a sunny street. But Mr. Schneiderman, who is divorced with a grown daughter, had also apparently used his position as an excuse to drink heavily, according to an account of one of the women he allegedly physically abused, Michelle Manning Barish. ìI would come over for dinner. An already half-empty bottle of red wine would be on the counter. He had had a head start. ëVery stressful day,í he would say,î Ms. Manning Barish told The New Yorker. In another episode, the attorney general is depicted as a man consumed by his own hubris, telling Ms. Manning Barish, ìI am the law.î There had been tabloid stories describing Mr. Schneidermanís alleged drug use ó which had also been passed around by Mr. Trump. His office denied the accounts, though The New Yorker article said Mr. Schneiderman had misused Xanax. Before those assertions, Mr. Schneidermanís avidity for a health lifestyle was taken for granted. He gave out books on wellness, with titles like ìReal Happiness: The Power of Meditation.î He attended retreats at the Kripalu Center in Stockbridge, Mass., and did yoga in the office. (Ms. Rosenthal noted that she and Mr. Schneiderman had co-sponsored a bill, in separate chambers, that protected yoga studios from certain regulations.) He might have a glass or two of wine at a fund-raiser, former staffers recalled, but nothing excessive. Mr. Schneiderman was a liberal fixture of the State Senate for years, with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of public policy and a willingness to engage in details. But former staffers also said that Mr. Schneiderman could be detached from the minutiae of the attorney generalís office, and rarely spoiled for political fights. While his predecessors, Eliot Spitzer and Mr. Cuomo, are large and assertive personalities, Mr. Schneiderman had a more passive demeanor, at least from what most people saw. He sometimes complained of insomnia, and was known to come into the office later than most employees and had mentioned taking sleep aids. There were also incidents of erratic behavior. In one case, a person who worked with Mr. Schneiderman in 2014, recalled an incident in which the attorney general canceled a series of news conferences after injuring himself in a hotel room in Albany and requiring help from a security detail. There was also concern in his office that Mr. Schneiderman dated women who were significantly younger. On Tuesday, Mr. Schneidermanís fellow Democrats in Albany were expressing shock at the details, citing a public persona that was far more subdued, almost to the point of being restrained. ìHe seemed beyond strait-laced,î said Assemblyman Sean Ryan, a Democrat from Buffalo. ìThe kind of guy who wouldnít get a bawdy joke.î Assemblyman Daniel J. OíDonnell, whom Mr. Schneiderman defeated in the 1998 primary for State Senate, his first elected position in Albany, also said that he had never seen the attorney general drink, but had been struck by a certain professional arrogance, perhaps born of his pedigree: Amherst College, Harvard Law, and a father, Irwin Schneiderman, who was a prominent corporate lawyer. ìHe had a tendency to talk down to people,î Mr. OíDonnell said. ìAnd didnít know he was doing it.î Mr. OíDonnell said the accusations were ìhorrifyingî and didnít ìcomport with the person I interacted with,î though he had sometimes been curious about Mr. Schneidermanís succession of girlfriends. ìI kind of always wondered why was that,î he said. ìHereís a handsome wealthy guy with a beautiful apartment on West End Avenue, and all these beautiful women. And no one is choosing to stay.î Mr. Schneidermanís reputation for propriety was so entrenched in Albany that he was meant to be lampooned at a legislative variety show on Monday night ó before the story broke ó for being ìso lame,î and unscathed by the scandals that have often waylaid Albany politicians. After the magazine article was published, that musical number was altered, exchanging Mr. Schneidermanís name for Chuck Schumerís, the Democratic senator from New York."

He was 86. His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Roberto Rigoni Stern, the mayor of Asiago, the northeastern town where Mr. Olmi had lived since 1959. Chronicling his countryís 20th-century evolution from a backward agrarian economy into an industrial giant, Mr. Olmi ìgave voice to a peasant civilization by going back to its origins,î President Sergio Mattarella of Italy said in a statement, ìhonoring the feelings of simple people and places where nature meets man.î Mr. Olmi was more popular at home than abroad, but several of his movies enjoyed international success. He was best known for ìThe Tree of Wooden Clogs,î a three-hour epic about 19th-century Lombardian peasant life; he wrote, filmed with a hand-held 35-milimeter camera and edited the movie. It won the Palme díOr at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, the festivalís highest prize. He was also known for ìIl Postoî (ìThe Jobî), a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age drama, released in 1961, about the isolating corporate grind in Milan, and ìThe Legend of the Holy Drinker,î adapted from a novella by the Austrian author Joseph Roth about a homeless man living beneath the bridges of Paris. It won the Golden Lion at the 1988 Venice Film Festival. ìLike his great precursors, Rossellini, De Sica and Visconti,î P. Adams Sitney, a historian of avant-garde film, wrote on filmreference.com, Mr. Olmi ìhas worked extensively with amateur actors, chosen simplified naturalistic settings, eschewed elaborate artifices or lighting, and employed an ascetic camera style.î ìOf all the major Italian filmmakers,î Mr. Sitney added, ìhe has the least problematic relationship with the church. For the most part, his films center upon an individual worker caught between employment and an individual quest to assert dignity through labor.î The director Martin Scorsese, in a statement, described Mr. Olmi as ìone of the last of the great filmmakers of the í60s.î Mr. Olmi was born on July 24, 1931, in Treviglio, a town in Bergamo province in northern Italy. His mother worked in a spinning mill. His father, a railway worker and militant anti-Fascist, moved the family to Milan when Ermanno was 3. When he was 16, he was hired as a messenger by the electric utility company Edison-Volta, where his parents by then also worked. He abandoned his plans to become an architect and, inspired by the films of Roberto Rossellini, took arts courses and persuaded Edison-Volta to establish a documentary division and place him in charge. From 1952 to 1961 he directed some 40 short documentaries for Edison-Volta. When the company commissioned him to produce a film about a hydroelectric dam, Mr. Olmi ambitiously assembled a crew of 25 and transformed the assignment into his first feature-length film. In that film, ìTime Stood Stillî (1959), he chronicled in an understated style the rapport between the damís watchman and his apprentice. ìIl Posto,î his first scripted feature, included a performance by Loredana Detto, whom he later married. She survives him, as do their daughter, Elisabetta, a producer; and two sons, Fabio, a cinematographer, and Andrea. Reviewing ìIl Postoî (renamed ìThe Sound of Trumpetsî for its American release in 1963) in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called it one of the 10 best films of 1963 and ìthe most impressive ësleeperí of the year.î ìOlmiís ability to make the camera speak realistically and poetically is beautifully revealed,î Mr. Crowther wrote, ìand his skill at directing inexperienced actors is manifest in the sensitive performances of all the actors.î Discussing ìThe Tree of Wooden Clogsî in an interview for the Criterion Collection, Mr. Olmi said: ìThe peasant world that I was reproducing in my film, and which still shows its traces in Asiago, was concerned with one and perhaps only one thing in particular, and that was a relationship with the land. ìIt was a relationship,î he added, ìthat simply consisted of asking the land to give what was needed for living.î Reviewing ìThe Tree of Wooden Clogsî in The Times, Vincent Canby wrote, ìOne becomes aware of the filmís beauties slowly, as one does with the details of a long, comfortable 19th-century novel.î Mr. Olmi was awarded a career Golden Lion by the Venice Film Festival in 2004, but he refused it. ìI didnít want to put the bookmark at the end of my career yet,î he said. He accepted the award four years later but went on to make more films, including the well-received World War I drama ìGreenery Will Bloom Againî (2014). He chronicled his career in a memoir, ìThe Apocalypse and a Happy Ending.î ìThe cinema is life,î Mr. Olmi once said, ìand life is the cinema for me.î"

The moves happened at the direction of Facebookís chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said a person with knowledge of the changes, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss them. The reorganization was intended to streamline the company and clarify who oversees what after a long period of growth and numerous acquisitions, according to another person involved. But the changes were accelerated after Facebook faced criticism recently for its lack of protections around user data, following revelations that the information of millions of its members had been harvested by a political consulting firm with ties to the Trump campaign, said one of the people. Mr. Zuckerberg was adamant about not firing any senior executives, despite pressure to make prominent changes, this person said. Facebook told employees about the reorganization in an internal companywide memo on Tuesday. Recode earlier reported the changes, which were confirmed by a Facebook spokesman. Facebook was born as a social network in 2004 to help connect people with one another. Over the years, it has become a more sprawling set of products through deals like the 2014 acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion. Many of the companyís divisions were allowed to operate with a certain degree of autonomy. Facebook now plans to organize its product and engineering teams under three new categories, grouping its biggest moneymaking services together and separating them from its moonshot technologies. One new group will focus on Facebookís key products, including the social network itself, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, all of which generate the most revenue for the company. The second will concentrate on emerging technologies such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. The third will be centered on ads, personnel, security and growth. Facebookís key products group will be run by Chris Cox, its chief product officer. The emerging technologies division will be led by Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer. And Javier Olivan, a vice president of growth, will lead the final group. Other executives are changing jobs as part of the shifts. WhatsApp, for instance, will now be led by Chris Daniels, a Facebook executive who was previously tasked with bringing new people online through a free or affordable version of Facebook called Internet.org. The roles of the companyís top two leaders ó Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebookís chief operating officer ó remain unchanged. Ms. Sandbergís business teams are unaffected by the restructuring. The social network also said it was appointing Jeffrey Zients, a former director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama, as a new board member. Facebookís changes echo some of the moves that Google announced in 2015, when it said it was dividing its core online advertising business from the rest of its businesses and created a holding company structure with the parent name of Alphabet. The change was part of an effort to keep Google nimble and innovative. But Facebookís reorganization has been complicated by the public outcry against the company. The company has been under scrutiny for the spread of misinformation through its site and how it was used by Russian agents during the 2016 presidential election to influence American voters. In March, The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had also misused the information of millions of Facebook users. Some of these issues have prompted disagreements among Facebook executives, leading to several departures. The Times has reported that Alex Stamos, the chief information security officer, intends to leave Facebook. Last week, Jan Koum, a founder of WhatsApp and a Facebook board member, also said he was leaving the company. The internal dissent hastened Mr. Zuckerbergís changes, said one of the people with knowledge of the decisions. More recently, the chief executive has been trying to move the company forward, including at Facebookís developer conference last week when he said the social network had a responsibility ìto keep building in meaningful ways.î Ari Ratner, a former Obama administration official who now runs Inside Revolution, a strategic communications firm, said the restructuring would likely have little impact on the root issues that Facebook has been grappling with. This ìwill have minimal impact on the issues themselves,î said Mr. Ratner. ìIf you want to send the message things will be different, Iím not sure if that accomplishes much.î Under Facebookís new emerging technologies group, Mr. Zuckerberg has also created a new team focused on blockchain, a digital ledger that underpins virtual currencies like Bitcoin. The group will be led by David Marcus, who had been overseeing Facebook Messenger, with the mandate of examining how Facebook can incorporate blockchain. Over the last six months, three people who have had conversations with Mr. Zuckerberg said he wanted Facebook to aggressively pursue applications for blockchain across the company. Facebook employees have discussed whether blockchain could be used to secure transactions between people. In a Facebook post, Mr. Marcus wrote, ìIím setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage Blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.î"

Halbfinger,World,Domestic Politics,"Nuclear weapon, US Foreign Policy, Embargoes Sanctions, Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump, Iran, Israel","JERUSALEM ó He offended the last United States president by trying to sink the Iran nuclear deal in Congress, antagonized the countries that had negotiated it, and helped make support for Israel a partisan issue in American politics. For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, President Trumpís decision on Tuesday to abandon the 2015 agreement was such a wholesale vindication that he abruptly cut short a trip to Cyprus to be in Israel when it was announced. It would have been unseemly, after all, to gloat while on foreign soil. ìIsrael fully supports President Trumpís bold decision today to reject the disastrous nuclear deal with the terrorist regime in Iran,î Mr. Netanyahu said moments after Mr. Trumpís remarks. ìIsraelis opposed the nuclear deal from the start because we said that, rather than blocking Iranís path to the bomb, the deal actually paves Iranís path to an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs, and this within a few yearsí time.î Even as Mr. Netanyahu spoke, Israel was bracing for the possibility that Mr. Trumpís move could free Iran of constraints that may have held it back from retaliating against recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria. Those attacks have come amid a shadow war in which Iran has used the cover of the Syrian conflict to build a military infrastructure there to confront Israel. Anticipating an Iranian attack along its border with Syria, Israelís military late Tuesday said it put its troops on ìhigh alert,î called up some reservists, set up Iron Dome antimissile batteries and warned local authorities in the Golan Heights to unlock and ready bomb shelters following the detection of what it said was irregular activity of Iranian forces. About an hour after Mr. Trumpís announcement, Syrian state news media reported what it called an Israeli attack south of the capital, Damascus. An official from the pro-Iran alliance in the Middle East said four missiles had been fired at an Iranian position in Al Kiswa, where there are bases used by the Syrian Army and its militant allies including militias backed by Iran. The official said two of the missiles were blocked by Syriaís air defenses, while the other two hit the site, destroying a truck with a radar in it. Syrian state news agency SANA posted a video of what it said was the site, showing a large fire in the distance with sirens sounding in the background. Israeli media described the airstrike as a pre-emptive one, saying one target was a convoy of missiles en route from a base in Syria to the frontier with Israel. An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Netanyahu waged an Ahab-like struggle against the nuclear pact from before its inception during the Obama administration. Now, President Trump has adopted his point of view ó not only about the agreementís flaws but also about Israeli evidence that Mr. Trump said ìconclusivelyî showed Iran had lied when entering into it. Mr. Trump also aligned with Israel on the need to increase pressure on Iran in hopes of curtailing its expansionism in the Middle East. ìFor the first time, Bibiís doctrine is going to be tested on a much wider scale,î said Anshel Pfeffer, a Haaretz columnist and author of a well-received new Netanyahu biography titled ìBibi,î the prime ministerís nickname. Being seen as fiercely taking on Israelís most fearsome adversary while standing shoulder to shoulder with its most critical ally can only help Mr. Netanyahu politically as he awaits a likely indictment in a sprawling corruption investigation. He is counting on being seen as indispensable to Israelís national security. Yet Mr. Trumpís decision also creates a new set of risks for Mr. Netanyahu and for Israel. After more than a decade without a major war, the country now faces threats from almost every direction. Even Mr. Netanyahuís most ardent detractors treat his obsession with the strategic threat posed by Iran as a sincere one. ìHis worldview is very clear,î said Ari Shavit, an Israeli journalist who has long covered Mr. Netanyahu. ìIran is Nazi Germany. Israel is England. He is Churchill and America is America. His main goal has been to persuade Roosevelt to get into a conflict that will crush Iran. It didnít work with Obama. But with President Trump he sees a golden opportunity.î Mr. Shavit added that Mr. Netanyahu sees Iran as both dangerous and fragile, like the weakening Soviet Union that Ronald Reagan confronted, and wishes for a similar American approach to it: very assertive American diplomacy and sanctions that exploit Iranís weakness to eliminate its danger. In that dream scenario, Iranís economy melts down under stiffened sanctions and the government follows. While cheering Mr. Trumpís decision, Israel could face some undesirable outcomes as a result of it. If Britain, Germany, France and perhaps Russia and China respond by backing up the nuclear deal and giving Iran added incentives to stick with it, the United States could wind up having squandered its leverage. Israel would have gained nothing and a wedge could be driven between the United States and some of its closest European allies. Alternatively, if Iran reacts by abandoning the agreement and restarting its nuclear program, it will be up to the United States and its allies to stop Iran ó ìor the nuclear deal will have been proven to have been the best deal available, and relying on Trump to be a very stupid move,î Mr. Pfeffer said. Ehud Barak, a former prime minister who was defense minister under Mr. Netanyahu when the two pressed for an Israeli strike on Iranís nuclear program, said he believed Iran would be even more cautious, following Mr. Trumpís decision, ìnot to make a mistake which would draw them into a direct conflict with the U.S.î ìThe real nightmare of the ayatollahs is to find themselves in a real clash with the U.S.,î said Mr. Barak, who was in Washington promoting a new memoir. ìThey play brinkmanship very artfully, but also out of careful calculation. And with this administration, they cannot really calculate.î War is, however, a distinct possibility ó and one for which the Israeli public is being prepared almost hour by hour. Iranís nuclear program is by no means the only or even the most urgent threat that the country poses to Israel. For months, the two adversaries have been engaged in an increasingly bloody and overt conflict in Syria, where Mr. Netanyahu says Iran is bent on establishing an offensive threat to Israel with drones, precision-guided missiles and Shiite militia members under Iranian leadership. And he is determined to prevent it. In recent days, the Israeli news media have been filled with feverish assessments and speculation that the Iranians, with the Lebanese elections and Mr. Trumpís decision behind them, will be freed to retaliate for recent airstrikes attributed to Israel on Iranís growing military infrastructure in Syria. Nightly news broadcasts have opened with unnerving scenarios of missile attacks launched by Iranís Shiite proxies and a possible infiltration attempt from Syria or Lebanon. Television crews have been checking the readiness of bomb shelters in northern Israel. On Tuesday, the United States chimed in, warning its employees in Israel not to venture into the Golan Heights, which borders Syria. Israel has also exposed an unusual amount of additional intelligence material, from grainy aerial photos of Iranian drones to the Iranian nuclear archive captured in a daring Mossad operation. Mr. Netanyahuís disclosure of that archive last week was an extraordinary departure for a country that, only weeks ago, acknowledged its 2007 bombing of a Syrian nuclear reactor. ìThese are warning shots directed not just at the Iranians, but also the Syrians and Russians,î Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said of the public-relations campaign. He said it was ìintended to tell the Iranians if they think they can disguise what they are going to do and cover their fingerprints through some proxy in Syria, that is not going to work.î This is not the first time that Mr. Netanyahu has rattled sabers toward Iran. But it is playing out quite differently than in 2010, when he first began agitating for a military strike to cripple Iranís nuclear program. At the time, Israelís generals opposed him, as did much of his own cabinet. Now, however, even moderate Israelis are concerned about Iranís belligerent moves, which have become more evident over time. ìThe conventional Iranian threat is much more clear, and this is why Netanyahu has the support of most of the Israeli military establishment, which he didnít have on the nuclear issue,î said Mr. Shavit. ìThere are signs of weakness in Iran domestically, which he thinks can be exploited. And with megahawks in the White House, they listen to him in a totally different way than the previous team did.î There has been debate within Mr. Netanyahuís government, to be sure ó but it has largely concerned not whether to confront Iran, but how to sequence that confrontation. One group, according to Mr. Zalzberg, the analyst, said that the nuclear agreement was flawed but that Israel faced more pressing challenges from Iran in Syria, and that the nuclear deal bought time for Israel to build the offensive capacity it would need to destroy Iranís nuclear program if it came to that. The other group, including the prime minister, views this as the most opportune moment to squeeze Iran with economic pressure and a credible military threat, Mr. Zalzberg said. ìTheyíre saying, ëWe have Bolton, we have Pompeo ó where will we be in two years or four years?íî he said, referring to the new American national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. ìëWe have a president who views this deal as a disaster. Now is the time.íî"

He was 89. His death was confirmed by Steve Merksamer, Mr. Deukmejianís former chief of staff. ìHe didnít have Arnold Schwarzeneggerís bravado, Jerry Brownís dialectical fireworks, or Pete Wilsonís Marine Corps willingness to take the hill,î Kevin Starr, the eminent historian of California, said in an interview in 2012. ìHe had such an understated manner, you almost missed how pervasive and effective he was in his governorship.î (Professor Starr, of the University of Southern California, died last year.) When Jerry Brown left office in 1983 in his first go-round as governor, Mr. Deukmejian, then Californiaís attorney general, ran for the higher office with an eye toward reforming a state judiciary that he considered too lenient. ìAttorneys general donít appoint judges, but governors do,î he said in an interview for this obituary in 2012. ìAnd we were very troubled in those days by a lot of the appointments Jerry Brown had made.î As governor, Mr. Deukmejian appointed some 800 judges, many of whom are still serving in Californiaís courts. In the 1982 race for governor, he defeated the mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley, by about 90,000 votes out of nearly eight million cast, a victory so narrow that some news reports prematurely pronounced Mr. Bradley the winner. When Mr. Deukmejian took office in 1983, a recession had caused unemployment in California to jump to 11.2 percent and eaten away at the stateís coffers. Billions of dollars had been used to shore up local governments after the adoption of Proposition 13, the 1978 voter initiative that radically cut property taxes. Instead of raising taxes, Mr. Deukmejian pared spending and balanced the budget. ìOur fiscal policy was to do everything we could to live within our means,î he said in 2012. In 1986, Mr. Deukmejian, the son of Armenian immigrants, surprised some conservative colleagues when he took a public stand against the University of Californiaís investments in South Africa during apartheid. In a 2005 memoir, David Gardner, who was president of Californiaís university system in the 1980s, wrote of the governorís stand on apartheid, ìAll of this killing and violence, directed mostly against blacks, reminded Deukmejian of the Turkish massacres of Armenians in World War I.î Recalling the episode in 2012, Mr. Deukmejian said, ìMy feeling was, there but for the grace of God go I.î Mr. Gardner had strongly opposed divestment, but at the governorís urging, the state pulled some $3 billion in stock holdings out of South Africa. During a visit to California after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela said the action by the University of California ó the first large public institution to take a stand ó played a critical role in ending white minority rule in South Africa. Mr. Deukmejian won a second term in 1986, again defeating Mr. Bradley, this time with 60 percent of the vote. In 1988, Mr. Deukmejian was approached by an official for Vice President George Bushís presidential campaign, telling him he was being considered as a potential running mate. ìI was apparently on a so-called short list,î he said in 2012. But he declined to be considered any further. ìI said, ëWell, I have a lieutenant governor in the other party, and if I were to join the ticket, the whole executive branch of the California government would go over to the Democrats,íî he said. ìThey already had control of the legislature. I couldnít do something like that for my own benefit. So I took myself out of contention.î A staunch fiscal conservative, Mr. Deukmejian was a consistent opponent of new taxes and government spending increases, to the point where his Republican colleagues in the legislature nicknamed him ìThe Iron Dukeî for repeated vows to veto spending bills. He later took credit for eliminating a $1.5 billion deficit, telling lawmakers in a State of the State address that he had ìtaken California from I-O-U to A-O.K.î But by the time he left office, having chosen not to seek a third term in 1990, tax receipts had slumped under the weight of a national economic slowdown, and his successor, Pete Wilson, a fellow Republican, entered the governorís mansion facing a deep budget deficit. Courken George Deukmejian Jr. was born on June 6, 1928, in Menands, N.Y., north of Albany. His parents had emigrated from eastern Turkey in the early 1900s. His father worked in a series of jobs ó as a photographer, Oriental rug dealer and paper wholesaler. His mother worked in a necktie factory. Mr. Deukmejian attended Siena College in Albany County, graduating in 1949 with a bachelor of arts in sociology. He received a law degree in 1952 from St. Johnís University School of Law in Queens. He entered the Army in 1953, and after infantry basic training was assigned to the Judge Advocate Corps based in Paris, where he assisted in the settlement of claims made by French nationals against the Army. In 1955, at the urging of his sister, who had moved to California, he drove across the country and put down roots in Los Angeles, where he was appointed a deputy counsel for Los Angeles County. In 1957, he married Gloria Saatjian, a bank secretary, and the couple moved to Long Beach, where Mr. Deukmejian opened a small law practice on the second floor of a bank building, specializing in ìanything that walked in the door,î he once told an interviewer. Mr. Deukmejian entered politics in 1962, when he won a seat in the California Assembly; four years later he was elected to the State Senate. While in the state legislature, and later as attorney general, he pushed hard for the death penalty. Mr. Deukmejian was known to be especially tough on crime. While governor, he presided over the building of more than a dozen prisons. After leaving office in 1991, he became a partner in the Los Angeles office of Sidley & Austin, commuting from his house in Long Beach, which he and his wife had lived in since 1960. He is survived by his wife, Gloria; their children, Leslie, George and Andrea; and six grandchildren. One of the signal moments in Mr. Deukmejianís governorship came in 1989, after a gunman killed five elementary school children in Stockton, Calif., using an AK-47. Bucking his party, Mr. Deukmejian supported a Democratic-sponsored bill outlawing semiautomatic rifles, one of the first such bans in the nation. Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco, who was speaker of the State Assembly when Mr. Deukmejian was in office, said of the governorís support for the ban, ìIt was the right thing to do, not the politically right thing to do.î ìDeukmejian was a registered Republican, but he elevated the level of governorship above his party choice,î Mr. Brown said in an interview. ìI think his time in office will be seen as the last the State of California actually had a bipartisan, working relationship between the governorís office and the legislature.î"

Will you let it happen again?,Fatima Boudchar,Opinion,Domestic Politics,"Torture,, Kidnapping and Hostages, Human Rights, Spying and Intelligence Agencies, CIA, Gina Haspel, Muammar Kaddafi, Thailand, Libya","I was abducted from exile in Southeast Asia and secretly jailed in one of Libyaís worst dungeons. But the worst torture of my life wasnít done to me by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafiís thugs. It was done in Thailand at the hands of the C.I.A. It was March 2004. During this nightmare ó my detention and ìrenditionî to Libya ó I was pregnant. Shortly afterward, I gave birth. After what the C.I.A. did to me, my baby weighed four pounds. Now I hear that Gina Haspel, who as a C.I.A. officer ran a black site in Thailand in 2002 that sounds like the one where I was tortured, has been chosen to lead the whole agency. On Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee will question her to decide whether she is fit to be director. I know what Iíd ask her if I got the chance. Did you know about my abduction and abuse? Were you involved with it? What will you say if President Trump asks you to do something like that again? Iíll never forget the sight of my kidnappers, dressed all in black and wearing ski masks, waiting for me in a white cell in the Bangkok detention site. My husband and I had fled Colonel Qaddafiís regime, moving from country to country to stay away from his killers. We were on our way to Europe when we were seized in Malaysia and sent to Bangkok, where the Thais handed us to our kidnappers ó people I now know, from documents found in Libya, were with the C.I.A. A man grabbed my head and shoved me into a truck. They blindfolded and trussed me. I donít understand why I was taken. I assume that the C.I.A. went after my husband because he led an Islamist group that openly opposed the Qaddafi dictatorship. But what did that have to do with me? I come from a small town in Morocco. I was not a political dissident. Iíd never been to Libya until the C.I.A. flew me there, and I never meant the United States any harm. I hardly thought about the United States until I was chained to the wall in the C.I.A. black site. I have no idea how long I was in the Thai secret prison because no one would let me sleep. The cell was white and stark, with nothing in it but a camera and hooks on the wall. The masked abductors were waiting. I was terrified. They chained me to the hooks. Because I was midway through my pregnancy, I could barely move or sit. Some of what they did to me in that prison was so awful I canít talk about it. They hit me in the abdomen just where the baby was. To move me, they bound me to a stretcher from head to toe, like a mummy. I was sure I would shortly be killed. For the rendition flight to Libya, I was taped to a stretcher again. The tape caught the corner of my eye. It stayed that way, my eye taped open, tears streaming down my face, for more than 14 hours. After I spent several weeks in a Libyan prison, Colonel Qaddafiís spies dragged a crib into my cell. I was gravely ill. If I lived through this, I thought, I would be forced to give birth, alone, in this filthy cell. Shortly before I delivered, they let me go. The birth was hard. My son and I lived in fear in Libya for years. My husband was in prison until 2010 and brutally tortured. We now live in Istanbul with our family. I donít know what Ms. Haspelís part in what happened to me was or what she thinks about it. All I know is what I read: that she ran a prison in Thailand that sounds a lot like mine; that she went back to the C.I.A. to work on counterterrorism; and that later, she was involved in destroying evidence of torture. The director of national intelligence has said that Ms. Haspel ìplans to be totally transparentî about what she did. I hope she will be questioned about my case and whether she condones it. If she played a part, she should apologize. If she didnít, she should swear under oath that the C.I.A. under her command will never again carry out abductions like mine. I also read that the C.I.A. says Americaís foreign allies respect Ms. Haspel. Maybe so. But if America wants to persuade the Muslim world it means us no harm, if it wants to regain lost trust, the C.I.A. canít ignore history in the hope that it will go away. People remember injustice for a long time. The only answer is to explain what happened. Even now, after everything I went through, I donít think badly of Americans. In fact, I think Americans deserve honesty from their intelligence officers. I donít believe most ordinary people would have supported what the C.I.A. did to me if theyíd known. I wonít get to ask Ms. Haspel these questions, but I hope a senator will. And if she wasnít involved, and feels in her heart that torturing me was wrong, she should say so. <U+2610>"

In his first run for public office, Mr. Pence, 61, ran a largely hermetic race, declining to debate his opponents and refusing most requests for interviews. Instead he made the rounds of Lincoln Day dinners and met quietly with voters in a district that stretches from Muncie to the north to the Ohio River to the south. ìIím ready to serve again,î Mr. Pence, who enlisted in the Marines after college, said to a cheering crowd in his hometown, Columbus. His closest challenger was Jonathan Lamb, who owns several small businesses and was the only candidate close to being financially competitive with Mr. Pence. The victor ultimately used connections to his brother and President Trump to raise more than $1 million for his race, an unmatchable figure. Mr. Lamb tried to make an issue of Mr. Penceís record in business ó a convenience store company he ran was forced into bankruptcy and was sued by a local bank for $3.8 million in unpaid loans ó but he could not overcome his opponentís structural advantages. Mr. Pence has lived most of his life in Columbus, Ind., one of the larger cities in the district, and his family has deep roots there. Mr. Pence now owns two antique malls in southern Indiana. He is trying to succeed Representative Luke Messer, who ran for the Senate. Mr. Messer won in 2016 with almost 70 percent of the vote, and Democrats do not have a well-known challenger. Mike Pence was elected to the seat in 2000 and served until he was elected governor of Indiana in 2012. During his campaign, Greg Pence said there was ìno daylightî between him and his brother or President Trump on major issues, and he will be hoping that strong support for the president in the state will benefit him as well. But that proposition will be tested because Mr. Trumpís trade policies could have a starkly negative impact on the economy of Columbus, which relies on exports for more than 50 percent of its gross domestic product, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. Mr. Trump and the vice president are scheduled to campaign in Indiana on Thursday."

Name Withheld Your colleague would seem deficient in the capacity for shame. He must know that his pilferings have been discussed in departmental meetings, and he remains undeterred. This suggests some measure of sociopathy. Your feelings, on the other hand, display a feature common in people who uphold ethical norms: a desire to see the guilty punished. (I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m putting aside your concern about leading students by example, because this presupposes that they know what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going on ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t suggest that they do.) What rankles, clearly, is that a serious norm has been violated with impunity. This moral sentiment shows up in a family of studies in experimental economics in which people play ‚<U+0080><U+009C>ultimatum games.‚<U+0080>ù In a typical game, someone is allowed to propose a split of a pot of money with someone she‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never encounter again. If you accept the proposed split, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what you get. If you reject it, both of you get nothing. So it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s never economically rational to reject a split, however lopsided: You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re turning down money. Yet across many societies, people will reject a split they consider unfair. What this shows, researchers suggest, is that people will pay a cost to punish antisocial behavior. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s said to be a form of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>altruistic punishment.‚<U+0080>ù All of which raises the question of how much effort you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re willing to expend to see rule-breaking punished. If you told the president, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d probably have to be willing to reveal to your colleague that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d done so and to give evidence against him. Your chairman would most likely also be displeased to learn that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve exposed the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s failure to act. If you went to the campus police chief, your college administrators would learn of your action, and, given the norms of institutional autonomy, they would take a dim view of it. Is the wrongdoer still getting away with it? If so, you could, in theory, continue to escalate. The money he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s stealing doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t come out of your pocket, but it belongs to your nonprofit institution, and misusing that money entails a violation of the public trust. That should interest the trustees of your college. And if they did nothing, then, in principle, the attorney general of your state ought to take an interest.

How far would you be willing to go? At a certain point, the pursuit becomes fanatical. Although your sense of indignation is commendable, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not your duty to enforce these rules, merely to report violations to the appropriate authorities, and you have. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d say you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve already done enough. Advertisement Let me add that there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something about this situation that puzzles me. Unless your colleague is hugely valued (for success in raising large grants, say), he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s putting his tenure at risk by this behavior. And the grants would be at risk if he were found to be indifferent to the distinction between mine and thine in his use of them. Furthermore, your chairman has plenty of ways to put pressure on him, like asking for refunds for unwarranted travel expenses, denying him raises and placing these facts in his personnel file so that there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a paper trail to justify later termination. My puzzlement is not about why you feel that something needs to be done about the problem but about why it isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t being done by the people whose responsibility it is. A female friend says she is planning to sell her late husband‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vintage collection of Playboy magazines, which she says are in excellent shape and worth a lot of money. Normally, this woman is a progressive feminist. Selling this ‚<U+0080><U+009C>literature‚<U+0080>ù would seem to run counter to ethical values in our ‚<U+0080><U+009C>#MeToo‚<U+0080>ù world. Am I off-base here? Name Withheld Within feminism, there is what one scholar has called a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>maddeningly deadlocked debate‚<U+0080>ù concerning sexual imagery and sexual subordination; you see this in the arguments over ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fifty Shades of Grey, ‚<U+0080>ù which some find to be liberatory and empowering of women and others find to be oppressive and glamorizing of abuse (and still others find to be just plain dull). According to Catharine A. MacKinnon, pornography ‚<U+0080><U+009C>makes the world a pornographic place‚<U+0080>ù; according to Judith Butler, pornography‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>phantasmatic power‚<U+0080>ù lies precisely in its distance from social reality. But Playboy is nobody‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Exhibit A in this arena. Playboy, though it has published significant journalism and fiction, has no doubt expressed disrespect for women, as has much of our popular culture. Still, thinking about the sexual body of a female stranger in a photograph doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t entail having any particular attitude to other women. Indeed, thinking about the sexual body of a co-worker, as people of both sexes surely often do, is harmful only if it leads to doing something offensive. Privately consuming pornography of this sort, or engaging in sexual fantasy, is not tantamount to harassment or assault or the creation of a hostile workplace. Nor can we assume that people will be made more likely to do these things by opening Playboy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pages. Old magazines, like old movies, are prone to display the casual sexism of their day. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not an argument for consigning them to the dump. In the age of the internet, what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s more, the disappearance of every copy of the magazine from the face of the earth would hardly reduce the availability of pornography. And ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who knows? ‚<U+0080><U+0094> maybe some of those who look through vintage issues of Playboy will encounter some fine short stories, by the likes of Margaret Atwood, Joyce Carol Oates and Ursula K. Le Guin. So your feminist friend can profit from her husband‚<U+0080><U+0099>s magazine collection, while remaining faithful to the ideas that drive the #MeToo movement.

It Depends,"It could take at least a year, maybe longer, if Iran decided to make its own fuel. But if it bought its fuel from another nuclear power, the warning time to a bomb could be about three months.",David E. Sanger,Politics,Domestic Politics,"Nuclear weapon, US Foreign Policy, Nuclear energy, Hassan Rouhani, Donald Trump, Iran","WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> No sooner had President Trump declared that he was exiting the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran than Hassan Rouhani, the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, reassured the world that he remained committed to making the accord work ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even if Mr. Trump did not. But he also left a vaguely worded, dangling threat: If Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, failed to keep the deal going with Europe, Russia and China, the clerical government in Tehran might conclude that America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s departure from the agreement freed it to speed up its centrifuges and begin enriching uranium at levels well above what was agreed upon in the summer of 2015. Mr. Rouhani said that he would not bend to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>psychological warfare‚<U+0080>ù from Mr. Trump and that Iran‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Atomic Energy Organization was ready to produce more nuclear fuel if necessary. All of which raised the question: If Iran tried to ramp up production, how long would it take to get enough fuel to build a bomb? Advertisement The answer is at least a year, maybe significantly longer, assuming Iran decided to make its own fuel, rather than buy it from another nuclear power. But if the nation starts down that road ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and reassembles the thousands of centrifuges that spin at supersonic speeds to enrich uranium ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the warning time to a bomb could be about three months. That is the same time frame that existed before President Barack Obama struck the nuclear deal. David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear arms, said it would currently take Iran eight to 10 months to rebuild its enrichment complex and acquire sufficient uranium fuel to make a bomb. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something less than 12 months, ‚<U+0080>ù he said in an interview. That, however, is only the first step because the fuel would have to be turned into a weapon. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Iran has studied that process for years, a point Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made last week when he revealed a stolen trove of old Iranian documents. The documents suggest significant conceptual progress in warhead design, but it is unclear whether the Iranians know how to produce the bombs or whether its missiles have the capability to deliver them. Mr. Albright added that he expected Tehran to show restraint, at least in the near term, and keep its nuclear complex in line with the accord‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rules. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m assessing they won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything‚<U+0080>ù that would violate the curbs, he said. Just building up a new stockpile of uranium would take awhile. When the deal was struck in July 2015, Iran had roughly 22,000 pounds of low-enriched uranium on hand, the kind used for powering nuclear reactors. But it had to ship almost all of it out of the country. The last time inspectors issued a detailed report, they indicated that Iran had less than 250 pounds in its stockpile ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not enough to make a single nuclear weapon, even with considerable enrichment to bomb-grade levels. That is why it would probably take Iran a long while to resume production: It does not have the uranium needed to keep a larger number of centrifuges running. Building that stockpile would be difficult. And the Iranians have already made clear they have little interest in bringing back their old, inefficient centrifuges. They were working on far more powerful models before the deal was struck, but could not begin to experiment with them, under the rules of the agreement, for another seven years or so. Advertisement Now, if Tehran declares that Mr. Trump has abrogated the deal and that its restrictions are effectively lifted, it could well decide to accelerate that work. William J. Broad contributed reporting from New York."

Here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, Ireland tests Facebook and Armenia changes leadership. Here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the latest: ‚<U+0080>¢ President Trump declared he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear accord, calling it a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>horrible one-sided deal‚<U+0080>ù that didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t bring peace and never would. But America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s European allies have committed to staying in the deal, raising fears of a diplomatic and economic clash as the U.S. reimposes stringent sanctions on Iran. The sanctions would require European countries to reduce their oil imports from Iran, while European companies would have to close their operations there or incur penalties from the American banking system. (Here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s how the world reacted to the announcement.) Our national security correspondent sees Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision as a grand, highly risky bet that he can ‚<U+0080><U+009C>break the regime.‚<U+0080>ù _____ ‚<U+0080>¢ The May 25 referendum on Ireland‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abortion ban has spurred Facebook to introduce tools aimed at preventing foreign meddling in the vote, like blocking political advertising from foreign groups and letting users flag questionable ads. Advertisement The social media giant hopes to use those strategies in future elections. But the big question is whether they will work. Transparency activists have already seen a surge in online ads from questionable sources, raising concerns that foreigners are trying to influence the debate. Researchers traced ads targeting undecided voters to conservative Roman Catholic groups in the U.S. Separately, U.S. senators identified around 20 states where Russian hackers probed election systems in 2016, but found no evidence that vote tallies were changed. _____ ‚<U+0080>¢ Meet Nikol Pashinyan, a protest leader who just became Armenia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interim prime minister. The former newspaper editor and political prisoner galvanized a civil disobedience movement that transformed the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political landscape in just three weeks, forcing aside the longtime president, Serzh Sargsyan. Meanwhile, Hungary‚<U+0080><U+0099>s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, was formally sworn in for a third term. Here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a closer look at the ways he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reshaped the country so far. Now Mr. Orban has the power to make constitutional changes many fear will further transform Hungary into an autocratic state. _____ ‚<U+0080>¢ Big in Europe: feathered headdress, tomahawk chops and Native American mascots. American sports teams have long faced criticism for using indigenous names and symbols in their branding. But the practice is popular among European teams and fans, who have their own ideas about what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s socially acceptable (like Buffalo Ben, above, the official team mascot for the Belgian soccer team K.A.A. Gent). Now, however, pressure to confront those stereotypes is growing, and so is their resistance to change. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a learning curve for people in Europe, but it needs to be done, ‚<U+0080>ù said a Native American woman living in England.

Peter Pan helps sick children. Not fictionally, financially. The author J.M. Barrie, above, who was born on this day in 1860, donated the rights to his most famous creation to the Great Ormond Street children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hospital in London in 1929. In a front-page report at the time, The New York Times estimated their worth at ‚<U+0080><U+009C>roughly $10,000 a year, ‚<U+0080>ù which it said was equivalent to a sixth of the hospital‚<U+0080><U+0099>s income. It would have been clear that the gift was of lasting value: The boy who never grows up was introduced in 1902, becoming the subject of a hit play two years later, and then a novel. He had already inspired a statue in a London park, and even begun his long career in movies. Advertisement But few would have guessed quite how long Peter Pan would pay. The copyright first expired in Britain at the end of 1987, 50 years after Barrie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s death. Within months, however, Parliament passed a measure granting Great Ormond Street a permanent right to royalties from the stage play and adaptations of it. Peter Pan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s adventures in America are also still helping the hospital; according to its website, the U.S. copyright does not expire until 2023.

Advertisement ____ 2. Who will succeed Eric Schneiderman? Will he face criminal prosecution? And what will happen to his legal challenges to President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policies? Many questions are swirling after the resignation of the New York attorney general, who had positioned himself as a foe of Mr. Trump and a defender of women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights. He resigned on Monday night after four women accused him of abuse in an article published in The New Yorker. The accusations included alcohol-fueled rages, racist remarks, prescription drug abuse and threats ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including to kill the women or use his power as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top law enforcement officer against them if they defied him. ____ 3. Five more top executives left Nike amid a sweeping investigation into allegations of harassment and discrimination against female employees. That brings the number of senior executives who have left to 11. They had run some of the highest-profile departments at the world‚<U+0080><U+0099>s largest sports footwear and apparel company, and a big question is whether their successors can hit the ground running.

Gina Haspel, President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nominee to run the C.I.A., faces a much-anticipated confirmation hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Advertisement Mr. Trump chose Ms. Haspel because she is a seasoned veteran of the agency. But that has become her greatest weakness, as critics pick apart her role in some of the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s darkest chapters, involving torture and secret prisons. We discussed Ms. Haspel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s controversial past on our podcast ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Daily.‚<U+0080>ù And on the eve of the hearing, there was a new twist: The principal architect of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, asked a judge at Guant√°namo for permission to share unspecified information about Ms. Haspel with the committee. ____ 6.

The question now is whether Mr. Pashinyan can fulfill his promise to jump-start the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s moribund economy. ____ 7. Heroin is scourging rural parts of Northern California. We went to Humboldt County, a coastal area long celebrated as a gateway to the scenic Redwood Empire. The opioid death rate there is five times higher than the state average, rivaling the widely reported tolls in states like Maine and Vermont. Residents complain of syringe litter and people shooting up in public. The problem is worsened by a sizable and still growing homeless population, an extreme lack of affordable housing and a weak local economy. Some users take meth to keep moving at night, when they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re most vulnerable to the police, and then turn to heroin during the day to feed their cravings. ____ 8. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There were cardinals!

Dylan Bundy Couldnít Get an Out,"Paxton, the Seattle Mariners starter, threw the seasonís third no-hitter on Tuesday in Toronto, while Bundy had a historically bad outing for the Baltimore Orioles.",Benjamin Hoffman,Sports,Sports,"Baseball, Orioles, Mariners,,","One pitched nine innings and did not allow a hit. The other faced seven batters and did not record an out. It is hard to imagine two starts in one night being more different than the ones recorded by James Paxton of the Seattle Mariners and Dylan Bundy of the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday. Paxton, a 29-year-old from Ladner, British Columbia, became the first Canadian to throw a no-hitter in Canada when he blanked the Toronto Blue Jays, striking out seven and allowing three walks for a 5-0 victory and the third no-hitter of the season. Bundy, a 25-year-old right-hander, took the hill against the Kansas City Royals and threw 28 pitches to seven batters. By the time Baltimore Manager Buck Showalter came out to pull him for a reliever, he had allowed five hits (four of which were home runs) and two walks, and all seven batters had scored. By the statistic Game Score, which was developed by Bill James to evaluate the overall performance of a pitcher, and then adjusted some in recent years by the statistician Tom Tango, the disparity between the efforts of the two starters was rather extreme. Paxton recorded a 95 under the Tango method, and Bundy recorded a minus-19. It was nearly as extreme under the James method, with Paxton edging Bundy 91 to 10, which according to Baseball Reference ties Paxton for the seasonís fifth-best start and tied Bundy for the 12th-worst. In truth, it is hard to imagine there being 11 starts worse than Bundyís, but Baseball Reference credits Matt Moore of the Texas Rangers with the worst start of the year. Just last week, Moore threw four innings, giving up 11 hits and 10 runs (all earned) while striking out one and walking two. That generated a Game Score of minus-1 under the James method. (Tangoís method actually has Bundyís start as the worst of the season, with that formula generating a score of minus-9 for Moore). It is all splitting hairs, of course, as Bundy, who actually tied for the highest Game Score in the majors last season with a 95, was mercifully saved by his manager in a start where he had no answers. Paxton, on the other hand, needed just 99 pitches to steamroll the Blue Jays in the first complete game of his career. All three of his walks came in the first four innings, and he got some help from his defense, with spectacular plays by Kyle Seager, Dee Gordon and Ben Gamel all helping contribute to the 299th official no-hitter in M.L.B. history."

During months of back and forth in response to subpoenas, lawyers for Jay-Z sought to limit his testimony in the case. They said that he had been on tour when his testimony was first requested and that he was now preparing for another. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed court papers asking that a judge order Jay-Z, whose actual name is Shawn Carter, to comply with a subpoena to testify. In their most recent response, the lawyers sought to limit any testimony to a single day. But the S.E.C. resisted limits, and the judge sided with its lawyers. ìIím granting the S.E.C.ís application to enforce the subpoena,î Judge Paul G. Gardephe of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said in court Tuesday. ìThe testimony has been delayed for five months, and I do not intend to tolerate any further delay.î The S.E.C. is investigating whether federal securities laws were violated in connection with Iconix Brand Group Inc.ís ìreporting of intangible assets, including the Rocawear assets.î Iconix wrote down the Rocawear brand by about $169 million for the year ending 2015 and by about $34 million for the year ending in 2017. The government wrote that after the sale, Iconix reported that Mr. Carter remained involved with the Rocawear brand and that he and Iconix maintained certain business partnerships. The S.E.C. said that it wanted to question him about, among other things, the value of the Rocawear trademark; his involvement with the brand after the sale; and ìmultiple emails, meetings and phone calls related to Iconix.î After briefly conferring on Tuesday, lawyers told Judge Gardephe that Mr. Carter would testify on May 15, an agreement that would appear to resolve a standoff over the scope of the subpoena and how much time Mr. Carter should make available. In court papers, the S.E.C. had said that an examination of Mr. Carter would ìtake at least a full day of testimony.î The S.E.C. said that it sent subpoenas to Mr. Carter in November and February but that in emails and phone calls his lawyers said he would not comply unless the testimony was limited to four hours. Mr. Carter eventually agreed to a full day, and his lawyers wrote that the S.E.C. had ìno legal warrant to insist upon more.î In court papers, Mr. Carters lawyers said the S.E.C.ís request should be denied because the government had not shown that his testimony was relevant and because compliance would impose an unreasonable hardship. The S.E.C., they added, had rejected their offers to provide information through a lawyer or telephone interview. They called the S.E.C. request ìunreasonably and unnecessarily burdensomeî and said it was ìdriven more by governmental fascination with celebrity and headlines than by any proper investigative purpose.î Judge Gardephe suggested that it was not up to Mr. Carterís lawyers to determine what information the S.E.C. should pursue, and he declined to institute time restrictions for his testimony. ìLimits sometimes incentivize respondents to waste time,î he said, adding that they might then want to ìin effect, run out the clock.î"

You have a habit of checking out local historic sites when youíre on tour. Is there any one in particular that you love? Have you ever been to the Teddy Roosevelt townhouse? He grew up in a townhouse in Chelsea thatís pretty well preserved, and this one woman is ecstatic if you want to take a tour. Does it have a lot of hunting trophies? Yes, it had a lot of birds that he taxidermied. And I remember her saying that he often had trouble on dates because he always smelled like formaldehyde. Theyíd be like, ìYou smell like formaldehyde,î and heíd be like: ìAh, bully bully! I killed a bird and stuffed it.î Do you consider yourself a presidential-history buff? I used to be a total Lisa Simpson about it; I used to be able to recite all the presidents, start to finish. I canít do that anymore. Now I have all the dead spots other people have. You know, John Tyler, I couldnít tell you much about him. If you were going to play a president, whom would you want to play, and why? William Henry Harrison. He was very funny because he was president for one month. He gave way too long of an inaugural address, where he caught pneumonia, and he died a month later. That would be great: A president planning his whole presidency and doesnít know heís going to die in a month. ìAll right, letís focus on the first 100 days.

Weíre talking about an hour of their night thatís a release ó not pretending things arenít happening. I love comedians that dive into politics. I personally donít feel comfortable, with my background, weighing in unless I have a take that I think is funny enough that I would put it in front of an audience.

Patton Oswalt has a bit about this that I will poorly paraphrase: Thereís so much stuff that you canít even make fun of the most current thing. Like, you write a joke about one thing Trumpís done and then 20 seconds later, heís done something even worse. I donít think itís hard to make fun of the biggest laughingstocks in the world who are in the news all day long. I do think itís hard to be original about it. You used to write for ìSaturday Night Live,î which the president sometimes seems to watch. Would it be tempting if you were still there to intentionally anger him? I mean, the standards have changed because he changed the standards of acceptability. Around 2012, when I was still there, we had a sketch with a sort of light, not too mean, cutaway to all of Mitt Romneyís sons ó it was a B-minus joke. It was just, like, ìOh, theyíre robotic, and theyíre all named Tad or whatever.î And we really debated it because, well, what have these children of his done? Whatís the point of making fun of them?

So, a groomsman became an informal ink bouncer. Others have been ìjust drunk enough to concede.î",Alicia Kennedy,Fashion & Style,Lifestyle,"Weddings and Engagements, Tattoo","Lindsay Morris and Stephen Munshin didnít have to step inside a tattoo parlor to get their first tattoos. All they had to do was attend the wedding of their niece Leslie Merinoff to Brian Kwasienski last October in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Ms. Morris and Mr. Munshin were aware there would be tattoos available during the reception. ìAnd we were not planning on getting one,î said Ms. Morris, a photographer. But by the end of the night, the Sag Harbor, N.Y., couple, who managed to stay ink-free into their early 50s, were using up a tattoo artistís last needles to have the number ì11î put on their wrists. Both were born on that day of the month. ìI guess the idea of it being small and quick made it more inviting,î said Mr. Munshin, the publisher of Edible magazines in the New York area. ìIt didnít seem as much of a challenge or investment. It was Lindsayís encouragement. I was just drunk enough to concede.î The occasion of a beloved nieceís wedding imbues the tattoos with more meaning, and it was, Mr. Munshin noted, ìa cool party.î Not surprisingly, both bride and groom sported tattoos. Ms. Merinoffís designs make up what she calls a ìroad map of her lifeî that signify special moments. When she pulls up the sleeves of her sweater in an attempt to get a count, she gives up almost immediately. While planning her wedding, she said she thought, ìWhat better moment to really keep forever?î Ms. Merinoff and Mr. Kwasienski, who are opening a boutique distillation company in Greenport, N.Y., chose the tattoo artist Bryce Oprandi of the Los Angeles area to work at their wedding. Ms. Merinoff had become a big fan of his work after following him on Instagram. When they met for drinks in New York, she said, she immediately asked him to be at the wedding simply for his laid-back energy. ìI thought to myself, ëI want this guy around,íî she said. The couple covered his travel and accommodations, as well as a flat rate for his time. They had planned for only a few of the 400-plus guests to get small tattoos from a limited selection featuring a coupe glass, the wedding date and others. But Mr. Oprandi ended up working on a couple dozen guests up until the end of the night. Tattoo artists are one way to subvert and personalize longstanding traditions, much like having mixed gender bridesmaids and groomsmen. ìSocial media has created a world where individuality is celebrated and personal brands are curated, so we find that same notion being implemented into weddings,î said Kristen Maxwell Cooper, the editor in chief of the Knot, a wedding website. ìCouples no longer want something cookie cutter. They want to throw an amazing party that truly feels like who they are as a couple.î Robert Fiore, an artist from Lansdale, Pa., who has been tattooing for 22 years, recently made weddings his whole business. He started the Wedding Tattooer last June, and since then, has gotten more than 2,000 inquiries for his services. For these events, Mr. Fiore creates a set of four to six small designs, each about the size of a golf ball, from which guests can choose. Heíll tattoo on legs, arms or shoulders. Chests and other more risquÈ body parts, he says, are generally off-limits. Mr. Fiore started this business almost by accident. ìIn November of 2016, my cousin was getting married, and a few months prior, he called me to say he wanted to have something ëawesomeí at the reception,î Mr. Fiore said. ìWe were going over ideas and I said, ëWhat if I just came down there and tattooed?íî His most extensive package costs $1,250, which covers as many guests as he can tattoo over four hours. Each design takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete, and he brings an assistant who places the stencil on each client and bandages the tattoos after theyíre complete. Mr. Fiore is not just called upon by the heavily tattooed. ìCouples and guests who wouldnít generally seek out a tattoo, when theyíre amongst their family and friends, theyíre feeling the moment,î he said. ìThat would be the one time that someone who has no interest in getting tattooed would.î What makes the wedding circuit so exciting, he said, is ìthe crossover.î Karen Glass, a Brooklyn artist, tattooed at one wedding more than three years ago and found it to be a transformative experience for the attendees. ìWe were busy the whole night ó a lot of people got tattooed,î she said. ìWe did a few peopleís first tattoos, including the mother of the groom. The guests were cheering and taking so many photos. It seemed to be an amazing experience for everyone.î Even those who didnít get inked were entertained. ìMost people love watching it happen,î Ms. Glass said. ìItís a great crowd-pleaser.î At Ms. Merinoffís wedding, not just aunts and uncles got their first tattoos, but friends as well. ìEveryone was so happy,î she said. ìThe space was so beautiful. Thereís a feeling that you donít want it to end, so you take a little bit of that energy and keep it forever.î Some guests, though, were not quite up to taking home such a permanent wedding favor. ìThere were some people who were too drunk to get tattoos,î Ms. Merinoff said. In those cases, a groomsman ìran interferenceî as an ink bouncer. Mr. Munshin and Ms. Morris look back fondly on their decision to get tattoos. ìIt was a little bit romantic,î Mr. Munshin said, ìand a little bit for amusement.î ìI like the way they peek out from whatever shirt Iím wearing,î Ms. Morris added. ìIt makes me happy.î"
183,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:07,0:01:01,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/well/live/low-carb-diet-type-1-diabetes.html,How a Low-Carb Diet Might Aid People With Type 1 Diabetes,"Children and adults with Type 1 diabetes who followed a low-carb, high-protein diet had ìexceptionalî blood sugar control and low rates of complications.",Anahad Oíconnor,Well,Health,"Diabetes, Nutrition, Carbohydrates, Children, Insulin","Like many children, Andrew Hightower, 13, likes pizza, sandwiches and dessert. But Andrew has Type 1 diabetes, and six years ago, in order to control his blood sugar levels, his parents put him on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. His mother makes him recipes with diabetic-friendly ingredients that wonít spike his blood sugar, like pizza with a low-carb, almond-flour crust; homemade bread with walnut flour instead of white flour; and yogurt topped with blueberries, raspberries and nuts. Andrewís diet requires careful planning ó he often takes his own meals with him to school. But he and his parents say it makes it easier to manage his condition and, since starting the diet, his blood sugar control has markedly improved and he has not had any diabetes complications requiring trips to the hospital. ìI do this so that I can be healthy,î Andrew, who lives with his parents in Jacksonville, Fla., said of his diet. ìWhen I eventually move out and go to college, Iím going to keep up what Iím doing because Iím on the right path.î Most diabetes experts do not recommend low-carb diets for people with Type 1 diabetes, especially children. Some worry that restricting carbs can lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels, a condition known as hypoglycemia, and potentially stunt a childís growth. But a new study published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday suggests otherwise. It found that children and adults with Type 1 diabetes who followed a very low-carb, high-protein diet for an average of just over two years ó combined with the diabetes drug insulin at smaller doses than typically required on a normal diet ó had ìexceptionalî blood sugar control. They had low rates of major complications, and children who followed it for years did not show any signs of impaired growth. The study found that the participantsí average hemoglobin A1C a long-term barometer of blood sugar levels, fell to just 5.67 percent. An A1C under 5.7 is considered normal, and it is well below the threshold for diabetes, which is 6.5 percent. ìTheir blood sugar control seemed almost too good to be true,î said Belinda Lennerz, the lead author of the study and an instructor in the division of pediatric endocrinology at Boston Childrenís Hospital and Harvard Medical School. ìItís nothing we typically see in the clinic for Type 1 diabetes.î The new study comes with an important caveat. It was an observational study, not a randomized trial with a control group. The researchers recruited 316 people, 130 of them children whose parents gave consent, from a Facebook group dedicated to low-carb diets for diabetes, called TypeOneGrit, then reviewed their medical records and contacted their medical providers. While it was not a clinical trial, the study is striking because it highlights a community of patients who have been ìextraordinarily successfulî at controlling their diabetes with a very low-carb diet, said Dr. David M. Harlan, the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. ìPerhaps the surprise is that for this large number of patients it is much safer than many experts would have suggested.î ìIím excited to see this paper,î Dr. Harlan added. . ìIt should reopen the discussion about whether this is something we should be offering our patients as a therapeutic approach.î The authors of the paper cautioned that the findings should not lead patients to alter their diabetes management without consulting their doctors, and that large clinical trials will be necessary to determine whether this approach should be used more widely. ìWe think the findings point the way to a potentially exciting new treatment option,î said Dr. David Ludwig, a co-author of the study and a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Childrenís Hospital who has written popular books about low-carb diets. ìHowever, because our study was observational, the results should not, by themselves, justify a change in diabetes management.î About 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Managing the condition requires administering insulin throughout the day, especially when consuming meals high in carbs, which raise blood sugar more than other nutrients. Over time, chronically elevated blood sugar can lead to nerve and kidney damage and cardiovascular disease. The standard approach for people with Type 1 diabetes is to match carb intake with insulin. But the argument for restricting carbs is that it keeps blood sugar more stable and requires less insulin, resulting in fewer highs and lows. The approach has not been widely studied or embraced for Type 1 diabetes, but some patients swear by it. TypeOneGrit has about 3,000 members on Facebook who ascribe to a program devised by Dr. Richard Bernstein, an 84-year-old physician with Type 1 diabetes. His book, ìDr. Bernsteinís Diabetes Solution,î recommends limiting daily carb intake to about 30 grams, the amount in a sweet potato or about four or five cups of cooked broccoli. Dr. Bernstein argues that the fewer carbs consumed, the easier it is to stabilize blood sugar with insulin. He recommends foods like nonstarchy vegetables, seafood, nuts, meat, yogurt, tofu and recipes made with almond flour, sugar substitutes and other low-glycemic ingredients. His plan emphasizes protein intake, which he says is especially important for growing children. Dr. Carrie Diulus, an orthopedic surgeon with Type 1 diabetes who follows a low-carb vegan diet, credits the Bernstein approach with helping her keep her blood sugar under control. ìIt allows me to perform complex spine surgeries without worrying about my diabetes because my blood sugar stays relatively stable,î said Dr. Diulus, who helped inspire the new study when researchers learned about her participation in the TypeOneGrit community. The most striking finding of the new report was that A1C levels, on average, fell from 7.15 percent, in the diabetic range, to 5.67 percent, which is normal. The rate of diabetes-related hospitalizations also fell, from 8 percent before the diet to 2 percent after, including fewer hospitalizations for hypoglycemic seizures. Those following the diet had increased LDL cholesterol, likely from consuming more saturated fat, which some experts said was potentially concerning and deserved further study. But other heart disease risk factors appeared favorable: They had high HDL cholesterol, the protective kind, and low triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood linked to heart disease. Dr. Joyce Lee, a diabetes expert at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study, said the findings were impressive and merited further follow-up, and that patients who wanted to explore a low-carb approach might do so while being monitored by their health care team. But she also noted that the patients in the new study were a ìhighly motivatedî group, and that it would be difficult for many people to adopt the restrictive regimen they followed. ìThe reality is that itís really hard to do low-carb, given our cultural norms,î said Dr. Lee, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. In an interview, Dr. Bernstein, a co-author on the paper, said it demonstrates what he sees in his practice: That there are diabetics on his regimen ìwho are walking around with normal blood sugars and they are happy about it, healthy, and growing if they are kids.î Derek Raulerson, 46, a human resources manager in Alabama, agrees. Both he and his son, Connor, 13, have Type 1 diabetes. Mr. Raulerson said he struggled for years to control his blood sugar. But six years ago, he gave up juice, bread, potatoes and other simple carbs, and made protein and nonstarchy vegetables the focus of his meals. Since going low-carb, he said, he has lost weight, cut in half the amount of insulin he uses daily, and watched his A1C fall from the diabetic range to normal levels. ìI have normalized, steady blood sugars now,î he said. ìI am no longer on the roller coaster.î"

Singing helps calm both the baby and the parent, experts say, and creates a bedtime ritual to signal a transition from the dayís activities. Carnegie Hallís Weill Music Institute created a lullaby project to help mothers bond with their babies. Tiffany Ortiz, the manager of the project, said it started in 2011 with a pilot at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, where staff members noticed that some teenage parents were having trouble attaching to their children. It has expanded across New York City, with artists working with parents at different sites, including high schools, hospitals, clinics, shelters and the Rikers Island jail, and is now being replicated nationally and internationally. Teaching artists work with parents, who draft a letter which speaks to their hopes and dreams for the child, Ms. Ortiz said, and the lyrics emerge from those messages. ìThen thereís a discussion about the musical side of it, how they want it to sound,î she said. ìUsually, parents will start to hum.î After the lullaby is created, it is recorded for the parent to keep, to refer to, to sing again and again. ìI am surprised by how rich and complicated parenting is, and how much music making in parenting is that way too,î said Emily Eagen, a musician and songwriter who has been a teaching artist in the program since 2011. When the project started, Ms. Eagen was pregnant. She is now getting her doctorate, and does research on lullabies from around the world, noting that lullabies can reflect many of the complexities of taking care of children, ìhow hard it is to exercise a certain amount of structure, how painful it is that they have to go through something hard,î like the separation and solitude associated with going to sleep. Anita Collins, a music educator who researches brain development and music, said that babies are born with relatively undeveloped sight but, under most circumstances, with perfect hearing. ìBabiesí auditory processing or hearing sense is actually the most important sense they have for the first two years of their lives, the sense that gathers the most information about their world,î said Dr. Collins, an associate fellow in music, mind and well-being at the University of Melbourne, Australia, and the author of the forthcoming book ìThe Lullaby Effect.î On April 20, the Carnegie Hall project released ìHopes and Dreams,î a recording of 15 original lullabies written by parents in New York from 2011 to 2015, performed by a range of artists, including Joyce DiDonato, Fiona Apple, Lawrence Brownlee and Patti LuPone. The goal of the project, though, is for parents to sing themselves, Ms. Ortiz said, to ìembed more singing into daily practice and into parentsí lives, shatter that notion they might not be able to sing or theyíre out of tune ó for a child, their voice is going to mean the most.î ìLullabies are very natural, but thereís not the perfect list of lullabies,î Dr. Collins said. ìItís about holding that child, looking them in the face, rocking them so they get the sense of the rhythm and the movement.î Researchers have looked at the ways that infants respond to maternal singing. But in research studies comparing babies who were held and talked to or left in their cribs and sung to, she said, the babies went to sleep more quickly if they were sung to. ìItís about having that connection they feel when someone sings to them.î Ms. Eagen recalled working with a mother who talked about the connection she felt to her baby when she saw the heart beating on the sonogram. ìThe doctor said, youíre the only one who will have this babyís heart beat inside you, youíll know each otherís heartbeat,î and that became the lullaby: Iím the only one who knows your heartbeat, and youíre the only one who knows my heartbeat. For a family with a baby in the neonatal intensive care unit, ìwe wrote a song: ëWeíre waiting for you to come home, and weíll celebrate with all the balloons in the worldí ó we were all in tears,î she said. ìItís very transformative. You donít know how much singing and writing a song is going to feel like you have agency ó it really does make a difference to do this.î Lullabies are important for the babies who hear them, but also for the parents who sing them, said Dr. Dennie Palmer Wolf, the principal researcher on the project, who put together research summaries on the importance of making music and on lullabies and wellness. ìMost of the mothers we worked with in New York live under very stressful conditions,î such as having a sick baby in the NICU or being homeless. ìRestoring a sense of positive well-being is extremely important; unless parents have that to draw on, itís hard to be consistent and emotionally available for their children.î ìFor a lot of women itís the first time theyíve written a song or even written poetry,î said Ms. Eagen. ìTheyíre love songs and theyíre work songs. Thereís a lot in lullabies about letting yourself do the work of parenting, calming yourself down,î she said. ìThe mothers get a lot out of being able to sing the song to themselves as well as to the child.î And, of course, lullabies are also about helping babies say good night. In a new show on the site Scary Mommy called ìLullaby League,î shot in New York homes, a cappella groups compete to sing babies to sleep. Micaela Birmingham, the siteís head of video and creator of the show, said the idea came out of watching friends who were desperate for a good nightís sleep, and putting that together with a fondness for a cappella music. They put out a casting call for a cappella singers and went into the houses of babies from 2 to 14 months, choosing families who were struggling with bedtime. When they made the pilot, with the group singing outside the babyís door, Ms. Birmingham said, they wondered whether it would have any effect. ìIt worked,î she said. ìThere was something mesmerizing about the singing, even with a bunch of strangers and cameras, and these were babies who were notoriously hard to get to sleep,î she said. The show is structured as a contest in which the singing groups are racing the clock to see who can put the baby to sleep fastest; the final championship round involves soothing a pair of twins. Jim OíHeir, the host, likes a cappella singing ó ìit just soothes my soulî ó but he didnít expect it to be particularly effective with babies. ìI was kind of blown away by it,î he said. ìThere were some babies wailing, really going at it.

It was the night before a few dozen of Ms. Dumas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new paintings would be shipped to New York for her first solo exhibition there in eight years, and the artist was drinking white wine and still contemplating which works would ultimately end up in the show. Several other monumental nudes, both male and female, were propped against the walls in two light-filled studio spaces, representing what she calls ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strange, mixed-up figures, not quite human.‚<U+0080>ù Interspersed among them were smaller oil paintings of bodily fragments: a lipstick-smeared mouth, a single breast and several renditions of two faces entwined in a kiss. Ms. Dumas, 64, walked through the space, its floor littered with half-squeezed paint tubes and its tables topped with art history books, museum postcards and photocopied images. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are, in a sense, individual works, ‚<U+0080>ù she said of the paintings, but they all have something to do with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>attraction, sensuality and desires.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement This is Ms. Dumas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s newest body of work, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Myths & Mortals, ‚<U+0080>ù which just opened at David Zwirner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s West 20th Street gallery in Manhattan and is on view through June 30. Half of the 61 works were painted in the last three months, she said, while others were from 2016 and 2017. They start with a series of ink wash illustrations Ms. Dumas made to accompany a narrative Shakespeare poem, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Venus and Adonis, ‚<U+0080>ù which inspired her to explore issues of eroticism, but also power and violence. They led her to examine similar themes in a series of paintings. Ms. Dumas is known for politically charged social art, often based on Polaroid snapshots, disturbing images clipped out of newspapers, or film stills appropriated from pornography. She has taken a radically new direction in this body of work: painting on significantly larger canvasses; using a more vibrant, chromatic palette; and stepping into mythological terrain. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>These works are really about the human condition, about people in their most basic state: They‚<U+0080><U+0099>re naked, they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re pregnant, they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re getting married, they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re kissing, they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re loving, they are erotic, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Zwirner said a week later, as the works were being uncrated in New York. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe for me the most shocking reality around this new body of work is that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re extremely political by not being overtly political. To make it about us, about love, desire and eroticism ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the themes that will maybe help us to get out of the political mess we got ourselves into ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I find extremely powerful.‚<U+0080>ù The Zwirner show is Ms. Dumas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first major solo presentation since her critically acclaimed 2014-15 retrospective, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Image as Burden, ‚<U+0080>ù presented at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Tate Modern in London and the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. She said it took months to shake off the psychological and emotional reverberations of co-curating the retrospective, which opened just after she‚<U+0080><U+0099>d turned 60 and included artworks from the mid-1970s. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Retrospectives are the worst; they are really killing, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re all the time busy with what you have done. You become a clich√© of yourself because you have to say who you are all the time, ‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As an artist, you are always who you are until you go make new work ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and then you are someone else.‚<U+0080>ù For the retrospective, she had hoped to produce new artworks but found it utterly impossible. But then the Moroccan-Dutch writer Hafid Bouazza asked Ms. Dumas to contribute illustrations for a book of Dutch translations of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Venus and Adonis, ‚<U+0080>ù one of the Shakespeare‚<U+0080><U+0099>s earliest works. It tells the tragic, sometimes funny, often erotic story of Venus‚<U+0080><U+0099> attempts to seduce Adonis, a handsome young mortal. He chooses instead to hunt and is killed. Ms. Dumas approached the project by reading Shakespeare in the English original and in Dutch translation (her native tongue is Afrikaans) as well as Ovid‚<U+0080><U+0099>s version from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Metamorphoses.‚<U+0080>ù She also explored historical depictions of Venus and Adonis from antiquity to the present. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was difficult to decide how to go about it, because you had to think, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>what type of figure, what type of woman am I going to choose for this Venus?‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the old paintings, she was mostly painted as these blonde, voluptuous women, and Shakespeare was writing about a kind of Mediterranean type.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement The resulting images are black ink wash on various types of paper reduced to essential elements of form. In one image, Venus is voluptuous with long, possibly blonde hair. In another, she might be an African woman with dark curly hair. In yet another, she appears like a vampire, with hollowed out eyes, inspired by an Edvard Munch drawing. Ms. Dumas felt that the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Venus and Adonis‚<U+0080>ù book illustrations could be an entry point into a new series of paintings, though she was at first uncertain. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Then my daughter said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You always make your best paintings of me.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not going to paint you, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m scared, and a pregnant lady doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fit into this exhibition.‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dumas has painted her daughter numerous times ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a particularly famous image is her haunting ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Painter‚<U+0080>ù (1994) in the Museum of Modern Art‚<U+0080><U+0099>s collection, depicting Helena looking sinister at about 4 years old, with her small hands dipped in black and red paint. Helena, now 29, is one of the few models Ms. Dumas has ever allowed in the studio. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not really interested in real people, ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It sounds strange, I know, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s because then I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do with my figure what I want. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s more about states and emotions.‚<U+0080>ù Nevertheless, she did begin a portrait of Helena from behind, standing tall in a strong, self-assured stance, which she named ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Amazon.‚<U+0080>ù Later, Ms. Dumas found an image of Inanna ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the goddess of love, fertility and war from Sumerian mythology, who was associated with the planet Venus ‚<U+0080><U+0094> depicted with wings and bird talons for feet. This was a starting point for another monumental nude, but because Helena was now pregnant and very much on the artist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, Ms. Dumas began to work her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s likeness into the image. Taking a sip of wine, Ms. Dumas mused, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My time is up, and I still haven‚<U+0080><U+0099>t painted a Venus. Well, I have indeed, but she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pregnant, and she looks like my daughter.‚<U+0080>ù The two quasi-portraits of Helena, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Amazon‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Birth, ‚<U+0080>ù appear in the same room of the Zwirner exhibition. It is all very fitting, since Ms. Dumas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first grandchild, Eden, was born on April 28, the day the show opened. Luckily, Ms. Dumas had flown to New York to install the exhibit and returned to Amsterdam in time to be there with Helena for the birth.

On the clock to trade him before he might become a free agent, the Mets salvaged something out of Harvey, trading him on Tuesday to the team they happen to be facing this week, the Cincinnati Reds. Harvey, one of the best pitchers in baseball less than three years ago, will now be a reclamation project on the worst team in baseball. In exchange for Harvey, the Mets received cash and the oft-injured catcher Devin Mesoraco, who was in the Redsí starting lineup for Tuesday nightís game until the trade was announced just under an hour before first pitch. Mesoraco, 29, then switched clubhouses at Great American Ball Park. Harvey, also 29, will not face his former team this week, as he will join the Reds for their next series in Los Angeles against the Dodgers beginning Thursday. His performance declined significantly after some injuries, and he had struggled mightily both as a starter and as a reliever this season. Harveyís tenure with the Mets came to an end after they designated him for assignment on Saturday following his refusal to take a minor league assignment, which was within his rights. The Mets had seven days to either trade him or release him if he cleared waivers. Tuesdayís deal is essentially a swap of players to fill needs. The Reds entered Tuesday with the worst record in baseball and a pitching staff that was largely to blame. The Mets desired catching help because of injuries to their two starters at the position: Travis díArnaud (who had season-ending Tommy John surgery) and Kevin Plawecki (who is expected to return later this month from a fractured left hand). Their fill-ins, the journeyman Jose Lobaton and the rookie Tomas Nido, combined to hit .156 with zero home runs in 33 games entering Tuesday. Mesoraco has been slightly better; he hit .220 with one home run in 18 games. He was once an All-Star, in 2014, when he hit .273 with 25 home runs. But in the 2015-2017 seasons, he hit .191 in just 95 games because of a litany of health issues including operations on both hips, a broken foot, and surgery on his left shoulder. The Mets are hoping a now-healthy Mesoraco can help. J.P. Ricciardi, a special assistant to the Metsí general manager, told reporters that right fielder Jay Bruce and third baseman Todd Frazier, Mesoracoís former teammates in Cincinnati, had spoken highly of Mesoraco before the trade. Harvey, who wanted to remain a starting pitcher, will now pitch at a home run-friendly stadium in Cincinnati. With some tweaks, the Reds can perhaps fix Harvey and flip him for a better return than Mesoraco could have garnered at the July trade deadline. Other teams were interested in Harvey, but the Reds were aggressive and fit the Metsí needs. The Reds owed Mesoraco just over $13 million this season, the final year on his contract extension, and the Mets owed Harvey $5.6 million this season, the final year before he was eligible for free agency. Each team will only pay the remaining salary for the player they dealt, said a person familiar with the deal, meaning the Mets will not pay extra for Mesoraco. In order to make room for Mesoraco on the active roster, the Mets placed Frazier on the 10-day disabled list with a left hamstring strain. Before Tuesdayís game, Mets Manager Mickey Callaway told reporters that Frazier had been dealing with some discomfort for weeks but that it worsened in Mondayís game. In a sputtering Mets lineup, Frazier had been one of the most consistent threats to get on base. To help, the Mets are expected to call up infield prospect Luis Guillorme from Class-AAA Las Vegas."
187,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,17:21:53,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/met-gala-catholic-church.html,Make Catholicism Weird Again,The Met Gala and the future of the church.,Ross Douthat,Opinion,Entertainment,"Politics, Museum, Party, Fashion, Christianity,1960s, Catholic Church, Sistine Chapel Choir, Cardinal Dolan, Rihanna, Marcel Proust","In 1904, during a debate in France over the anticlerical governmentís takeover of church property, a young Marcel Proust wrote an essay for Le Figaro inviting readers to imagine a future in which the Catholic Church vanished completely from his countryís memory, leaving only the bones of French cathedrals as its monuments. Then he further imagined the cultured elites of some future France rediscovering the texts and chants and rubrics of Catholic liturgy, and in a spasm of enraptured aestheticism, restoring the cathedrals and training actors to recreate the Tridentine Rite Mass. In his vision, like devotees of Wagner making pilgrimage, ìcaravans of swells make their way to Ö Amiens, Chartres, Bourges, Laon, Rheims, Rouen, Paris,î and inside Franceís Gothic churches ìthey experience the feeling they once sought in Bayreuth Ö enjoying a work of art in the very setting that had been built for it.î But of course the recreated Catholic liturgy and revived Catholic aesthetic would never be the real thing; the actors might know their roles, and the incense might waft thick, but attendees could ìonly ever be curious dilettantes; try as they might, the soul of times past does not dwell within them.î Proustís essay, lately translated by Catholic traditionalists, came to mind while watching the beautiful and blasphemous spectacle at the Met Gala on Monday night, where a parade of stars and fashionistas swanned about in costumes inspired by the aesthetics of Catholicism, while a wide variety of genuinely Catholic articles, from vestments to tiaras, were displayed in a Met exhibit titled ìHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.î Like Proustís ìcaravans of swellsî attending liturgical performances, the attendees at the Met were paying a cultural homage to the aesthetic riches of the Roman Church ó when, of course, they werenít sexing them up for shock value. But the spectacle was not exactly Proustís prophecy come to life, because unlike in his thought experiment, Catholicism today remains a living faith ó weakened but hardly gone, with as complicated a relationship to its own traditions as any lapsed-Catholic museum curator or celebrity dressing up as the Maid of Orleans. This complication is apparent in the Catholic response to the Met Gala itself, which consisted of an institutional blessing for the spectacle ó not just Cardinal Timothy Dolan opening the museum exhibit, but the Sistine Chapel Choir performing for the swells and starlets in the evening ó followed by an angry Catholic social-media backlash against the eveningís various impieties. When a living faith gets treated like a museum piece, itís hard for its adherents to know whether to treat the moment as an opportunity for outreach or for outrage. But the complexity runs much deeper, because to the extent that part of the Proustian prophecy has come true, to the extent that elements of the Catholic tradition have turned into archaic curiosities to be rediscovered by aesthetes and donned lewdly by Rihanna, the choices made by the churchís own leaders have played as much of a role as the anticlericalism of Proustís era. It was the churchís own leadership that decided, in the years following the Second Vatican Council, that the attachment to the church as culture had become an impediment to the mission of preaching the gospel in the modern world. It was the leadership that embraced a different approach, in which Catholic Christianity would seek to enter more fully into modern culture, adopting its styles and habits ó modernist and even brutalist church architecture, casual dress, guitar music, a general suburban and Protestant affect, etc. ó in order to effectively transform it from within. It was the leadership that decided that much of what Proust depicted as Catholicismís cultural glory ó the old Mass above all, but also a host of customs and costumes and rituals ó needed to be retired in order to reach people in a more disenchanted age. This idea was hardly absurd in theory; from Roman Empire days through missionary efforts, Christianity had often advanced through inculturation, importing a consistent religious message into varying cultural forms. But Catholicismís attempt to do the same with modern culture since the 1960s has largely seemed to fail. The secular culture welcomed the churchís Protestantization and demystification and even secularization, praised the bishops and theologians who pursued it, and then simply pocketed the concessions and ignored the religious ideas those concessions were supposed to advance. Meanwhile, that same secular world maintained a consistent fascination, from ìThe Exorcistî down to, well, the Met Gala, with all the weirder parts of Catholicism that were supposedly a stumbling block to modernityís conversion. This failure, and how exactly Catholics should interpret it, helps frame the debates roiling the church in the age of Pope Francis. One theory is that the evidence of the last 50 years suggests that modern culture is inherently anti-religious or anti-Catholic in some abiding way, which means the attempt to adopt its cultural forms and ìaccompanyî its denizens will inevitably end in dissolution for the church itself. Thus the only plausible approach for Catholicism is to offer itself, not as a chaplaincy within modern liberalism, but as a full alternative culture in its own right ó one that reclaims the inheritance on display at the Met, glories in its own weirdness and supernaturalism, and spurns both accommodations and entangling alliances (including the ones that conservative Catholics have forged with libertarian-inflected right-wing political movements). The other view is that in fact inculturation has not gone far enough, that the church may have changed its liturgy and costumes, but itís still held back by its abstract dogmas and arid legalisms, and that one final great leap into modernity, a renewed commitment to accompaniment and understanding and adaptation, is necessary for the church to gain what it sought when it began its great demystification project 50 years ago. As pontiff, Francis has been on both sides of these debates. The radicalism of his economic and ecological vision, often portrayed as simply liberal, actually represents a kind of left-leaning pessimism that arguably points backward to the strenuous critiques of modernity issued by 19th-century popes. And at times this radicalism has been matched by his willingness to join conservative members of his flock in culture war ó as recently in the Alfie Evans case in England, where the pope ended up in a public conflict with the more culturally accommodating sort of Catholic over whether to defer to medical professionals and deprive a brain-damaged toddler of oxygen because his life was judged no longer worth sustaining. But only at times; on many other fronts, the Francis era has been a springtime for accommodation and inculturation, and especially for the secularizing and Protestantizing German Catholicism that helped forge the original revolution of the 1960s, and whose leaders believe that only further modernization can refill their empty churches. Under German influence, but with the popeís implicit blessing, Catholic rules on divorce and now perhaps intercommunion may be joining the Latin Mass and meatless Fridays on the altar of sacrifices to the culture of the modern world. Meanwhile in the case of the opulent style of Catholic fashion on display at the Met Gala, it is very clear where Francis stands. As Tara Isabella Burton points out in an astute piece for Vox, itís the popeís traditionalist adversaries who are more likely to don the sort of ìheavenlyî garb being feted and imitated at the Met ó while from his own simple choice of dress to his constant digs at overdressed clerics and fancy traditionalists, the pope believes that baroque Catholicism belongs in a museum or at a costume gala, and that the churchís future lies in the simple, the casual, the austere and the plain. For this, as for his doctrine-shaking innovations, Francis has won admiring press. But as with the last wave of Catholic revolution, there is little evidence that the modernizing project makes moderns into Catholics. (The latest Gallup data, for instance, shows American Mass attendance declining faster in the Francis era.) Instead, the quest for accommodation seems to encourage moderns to divide their sense of what Catholicism represents in two ó into an Old Church thatís frightening and fascinating in equal measure, and a New Church thatís a little more liked but much more easily ignored. Francis and other would-be modernizers are right, and have always been right, that Catholic Christianity should not trade on fear. But a religion that claims to be divinely established cannot persuade without a lot of fascination, and far too much of that has been given up, consigned to the museum, as Western Catholicism has traced its slow decline. Here the Met Gala should offer the faith from which it took its theme a little bit of inspiration. The path forward for the Catholic Church in the modern world is extraordinarily uncertain. But there is no plausible path that does not involve more of what was displayed and appropriated and blasphemed against in New York City Monday night, more of what once made Catholicism both great and weird, and could yet make it both again."

So a Michigan man has built a house in South Beach that should withstand the water.,Brett Sokol,Style,Lifestyle,"Real Estate and Housing, Architecture, Interior Design, Flood","A 21st-century Atlantis-in-the-making is how many scientists think of Miami Beach. With a projected sea-level rise of three to four feet by the centuryís end, huge chunks of the barrier-island city are expected to lie beneath the Atlantic Ocean. But Hany Boutros is staying. In fact, Mr. Boutros, 43, a Detroit-area health care executive and real estate developer, has built a new 3,500-square-foot home in South Beach, the cityís most threatened neighborhood. ìI would be foolish if I didnít take sea-level rise into consideration, but itís not going to stop me from living the life I want,î he said, standing inside his Prairie Avenue homeís entryway. ìI found a solution,î he added, motioning to the retractable automated stairway that connects a 9,400-square-foot open-air gated tropical garden and parking area with the three-bedroom house above it. Designed by the Miami architect Rene Gonzalez as the first in a series of luxury ìelevated housesî around South Florida, it has been built to allow up to 10 feet of storm surge to safely flow underneath it. ìThe house already went through a test when Irma hit,î Mr. Boutros said, referring to the hurricane that swamped greater Miami in September. It was reported that Irmaís 185-mile-an-hour winds had largely spared the area, but it was a different story on the ground. Wind-driven rain flooded the ultramodern high rises and Art Deco hotels alike; two feet of water sloshed through some neighborhoods, while others were left without electricity for weeks. Back in Michigan, Mr. Boutros was poking around Facebook, desperate for a post-Irma update on how his new house had fared. ìI saw a nearby neighbor posting pictures of flooding and tree damage as she walked around,î he said. Mr. Boutros messaged her, gave her the access codes to the control panels that essentially run his home and asked her to step inside it. The rest of the street had lost power, but his front gate opened, and the retractable staircase smoothly descended 10 feet on its system of pulleys and cables. ìBecause I have a generator that turns on automatically, the house ended up being a shelter. I said, ëBring your friends, bring your kids, thereís hot water for showers ó please use it!í I had zero damages. It was as if Irma went around my house,î he said. That was no accident, Mr. Gonzalez said. ìRather than fighting the situation, we have to create spaces that allow us to live in a way that is closer to the environment, closer to the way the Seminole Indians in Florida lived,î with their Chickee huts up off the ground on stilts, protecting against water and allowing ventilating breezes to blow through. Mr. Gonzalez has taken that same approach to the glass walls of this homeís living room. They act as pocket doors, entirely sliding away to create another open-air space. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Mr. Gonzalez used glass sparingly. With the homeís overall cost at $1,700 a square foot, exposed and treated concrete dominates ìwith planes that just float, without gravity, if you will.î ìThe walls donít touch the floor. They go up beyond the ceiling, appearing to continue to the sky. It gives you the effect of infinite space.î Miami artists also feature prominently. In the dining room, a massive sculpture by Sinisa Kukec resembles two golden raindrops plinking into puddles. One guest bedroom displays an abstract painting by Lynne Golob Gelfman, the other a drawing by Michele Oka Doner. Separate control panels allow guests to access these rooms and come and go on their own, even if other parts of the home remain locked. While Mr. Gonzalez praised Miami Beach officials for tackling sea-level rise with a $500 million street-raising and pumping project (one that is being re-evaluated amid concerns that plans for further elevated roads may actually worsen flooding of adjoining homes and businesses in the short term), he said he was frustrated with many in the real estate community. Some architects seem happy to take their wedding cake-style McMansions and jack them up on stilts, he noted, regardless of what he calls the poor aesthetics. And some developers still seem to be in denial. That much was clear in Jeff Goodellís 2017 book ìThe Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World.î Mr. Goodell wrote of cornering Jorge PÈrez at an event honoring Ms. Oka Doner inside his namesake PÈrez Art Museum Miami. Ms. Oka Doner had already sold her Miami Beach home, convinced that it would soon be underwater. Mr. PÈrez, one of South Floridaís largest condo developers, was more skeptical. Asked by Mr. Goodell if sea-level rise had altered his business thinking, he replied curtly that it hadnít. Pressed, Mr. PÈrez said, ìIn 20 or 30 years, someone is going to find a solution for this.î He added, ìBesides, by that time, Iíll be dead, so what does it matter?î For his part, Mr. Boutros said the rising sea wasnít his only concern. Raised in Lebanon before he moved to Detroit to attend college, Mr. Boutros said he practically lived on Beirutís shoreline. Sun-dappled Miami Beach was a homecoming of sorts, but he was aware of security issues. Hence the retractable staircase. ìIím not here 24/7,î he said. ìHow do we make sure thereís no access to the house?î With a chuckle, he added, ìPlus, I wanted something out of James Bond, something sexy.î The same playfully louche theme carries through to his master bedroom, where a large doorless shower with transparent glass walls occupies the center of the room. This is not a home for anyone, or their overnight guests, who is bashful about disrobing. ìIf someone is with you in this room and youíre not comfortable being naked with them, they shouldnít be in this room,î Mr. Boutros said. ìWhatís the difference between standing naked in the middle of the room and being naked in bed?î Mr. Boutros wasnít waiting for a reply. He was already bounding up a staircase that led from his bedroom to a roof deck. Open on one side except for a barely there railing, it too was not for the cautious. Or anyone less than sure footed in high heels. Or anyone whoíd had a drink or two. Or children. Or Ö but Mr. Boutros waved off those concerns as well. ìItís my space. If I invite you up to the roof, I already know what youíre capable of handling.î His guests seem to have to pass an awful lot of tests just to get past the front door. ìIn a good way!î he said, laughing. The roof setting made Mr. Boutrosí brazen enthusiasm more understandable. Partially shrouded by a tropical canopy, it admitted no sound but the chirping of birds. In Michigan, Mr. Boutros works from 8:30 a.m. until 1 or 2 in the morning, so he can board a plane to Florida on Friday and remain through the weekend. ìWhen I wake up in Miami, my biggest worry is where Iím going to eat that night,î he said. That and, ìCan I spend two hours at the beach?î"

Still, the Miami police chief, Jorge R. Colina, and the state attorney for Miami-Dade County, Katherine Fernandez Rundle, sought to reassure the public that they would not tolerate the sort of behavior displayed by the officer on May 3. ìOfficer Mario Figueroa can have no excuse for the alleged actions seen on the videotape,î Ms. Fernandez Rundle said in a statement. ìThis community demands respect for all individuals taken into custody. Evidence of abuse, which is evidence of a crime, will allow us to go forward with this prosecution.î At first, Chief Colina suspended Officer Figueroa with pay, pending the results of an internal investigation. But on Tuesday, Chief Colina said the department had ìbegun the termination process.î In a statement, Edward Lugo, the president of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 20, argued that Officer Figueroa had not violated department policy, and had in fact exercised ìgreat restraintî during the episode. ìIt is unfortunate that because of social media, Officer Figueroa has been found guilty by some in the public without the proper due process afforded to anyone accused,î Mr. Lugo said in a statement. ìBecause of political pressure, Officer Figueroa is being charged with a simple assault. There is no doubt that Officer Figueroa will be exonerated.î Widely viewed video recorded by a witness shows what many saw as an unnecessary use of force by Officer Figueroa. It shows David Vladim Suazo, the suspect in a vehicle theft, facedown on the ground, handcuffed and motionless. The video then shows Officer Figueroa running toward Mr. Suazo and swinging his leg forcefully at Mr. Suazoís head. Miamiís mayor, Francis Suarez, initially told The New York Times he was ìdisgusted byî what he saw, and Ms. Fernandez Rundle said she was ìshocked and appalled.î On Tuesday, however, Ms. Fernandez Rundleís office released video that added a layer of nuance to the situation. In the video, Mr. Suazo chides Officer Figueroa, pointing out that he was unsuccessful in his apparent attempt to kick him. ìYou missed trying to kick me,î Mr. Suazo says, before adding, ìLearn how to aim, my boy.î ìIf I wanted to kick you,î Officer Figueroa replies, ìyou know I would have kicked you, right?î Prosecutors said that Officer Figueroa, who has been with the department for two years, would have faced a more serious battery charge had his kick made physical contact with Mr. Suazo. Florida state law describes an assault as any ìintentional, unlawful threatî to do violence to another person that causes that person to actually fear that violence is imminent. The law allows a person convicted of a second-degree misdemeanor to be sentenced to up to 60 days in prison. Mr. Suazo has been charged with grand theft, fleeing a police officer and traffic violations. The police say they chased Mr. Suazo ó who was allegedly driving a stolen vehicle ó through a residential complex before he crashed, fled on foot and eventually was taken into custody."

Cohen used to pay hush money to a pornographic film actress received payments totaling more than $1 million from an American company linked to a Russian oligarch and several corporations with business before the Trump administration, according to documents and interviews. Financial records reviewed by The New York Times show that Mr. Cohen, President Trumpís personal lawyer and longtime fixer, used the shell company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., for an array of business activities that went far beyond what was publicly known. Transactions totaling at least $4.4 million flowed through Essential Consultants starting shortly before Mr. Trump was elected president and continuing to this January, the records show. Among the previously unreported transactions were payments last year totaling about $500,000 from Columbus Nova, an investment firm in New York whose biggest client is a company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, the Russian oligarch. A lawyer for Columbus Nova, in a statement Tuesday, described the money as a consulting fee that had nothing to do with Mr. Vekselberg. Other transactions described in the financial records range from hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments by Fortune 500 firms with business before the Trump administration, to small amounts related to unexplained activities in foreign countries. References to the transactions first appeared in a document posted to Twitter on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star who was paid $130,000 by Essential Consultants to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The lawyerís six-page document, titled ìPreliminary Report of Findings,î does not explain the source of his information but describes in detail dates, dollar amounts and parties involved in various dealings by Mr. Cohen and his company. The Timesís review of financial records confirmed much of what was in Mr. Avenattiís report. In addition, a review of emails and interviews shed additional light on Mr. Cohenís dealings with the company connected to Mr. Vekselberg, who was stopped and questioned at an airport earlier this year by investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Taken together, the Timesís reporting and Mr. Avenattiís document offer the most detailed picture to date on Mr. Cohenís business dealings and financial entanglements in the run-up to and aftermath of the election. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Mr. Cohen for possible bank fraud and election-law violations, among other matters, according to people briefed on the investigation. Stephen Ryan, a lawyer representing Mr. Cohen, declined to comment. Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, is suing Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump to break her nondisclosure agreement related to the $130,000, and Mr. Avenatti has asserted that Mr. Cohenís use of Essential Consultants to make the payment potentially violated banking laws. Mr. Cohen also used the same company to collect $250,000 after arranging payments in 2017 and 2018 by a major Republican donor, Elliott Broidy, to a former Playboy model he allegedly impregnated, according to news reports last month. Among the other payments to Mr. Cohenís company described in the financial records were four for $99,980 each between October 2017 and January 2018 by Novartis Investments SARL, a subsidiary of Novartis, the multinational pharmaceutical giant based in Switzerland. Novartis ó whose chief executive was among 15 business leaders invited to dinner with Mr. Trump at the World Economic Forum in January ó spent more than $10 million on lobbying in Washington last year and frequently seeks approvals from federal drug regulators. Novartis did not respond to requests for comment. In addition, Korea Aerospace Industries paid Mr. Cohenís company $150,000 last November, according to the records. The company, an aircraft manufacturer, is partners with Lockheed Martin, the American defense contractor, in competition for a multibillion dollar contract to provide trainer jets for the United States Air Force that is expected to be awarded this year. A representative for Korea Aerospace declined to comment. AT&T made four payments totaling $200,000 between October 2017 and January 2018, according to the documents. AT&T, whose proposed merger with Time Warner is pending before the Justice Department, issued a statement on Tuesday evening confirming that it made payments to Mr. Cohenís firm. ìEssential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,î the statement said. ìThey did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.î This story will be updating."

Hook","WASHINGTON ó When President Trump made the surprise announcement in March that he would soon meet with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was thousands of miles away, an absence interpreted as a sign of Mr. Tillersonís irrelevance. Mr. Trump soon replaced Mr. Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, who has promised to bring back the State Departmentís ìswaggerî and import. But on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump made what could be the most significant diplomatic announcement of his presidency ó that he would exit the Iran nuclear agreement ó his chief diplomat was again thousands of miles away, this time on an unannounced visit to Pyongyang, the Northís capital, to lay further groundwork for a summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. The absence of Mr. Pompeo and other top State Department officials left perplexed European diplomats privately complaining that they were having trouble getting answers from Washington, and created an uncertainty about what was next that spanned the Atlantic Ocean. Senior State Department officials were momentarily speechless Tuesday when asked why Mr. Pompeo did not delay his trip by a day to be in Washington during Mr. Trumpís Iran deal announcement. Mr. Pompeo left for Pyongyang on Monday night. One official cited the separate nature of the two sets of negotiations. Another said Mr. Pompeo had remained reachable, citing the planeís communications system. But the secretaryís aging plane has such poor equipment that calls are often dropped midsentence. Brian Hook, who led negotiations with the Europeans for a supplemental agreement to the Iran deal, was also on the plane to Pyongyang on Tuesday, worsening the communications problems. The senior State Department officials who briefed reporters in the moments after Mr. Trumpís announcement confirmed that they did not know whether European countries would fight the administrationís plan to reimpose sanctions on Iran, a crucial test of whether the administrationís strategy would work. Nor does the administration know whether European countries will agree to try to negotiate a new agreement with Iran or whether a tentative deal the two sides created to address Iranís ballistic missile program would go into effect, the officials said. One of the officials said American and European officials had not discussed a Plan B. Those discussions were beginning Tuesday, the official said, although neither Mr. Pompeo nor Mr. Hook was in Washington or any European capital to begin them. Meanwhile, Mr. Pompeo told reporters on his plane that his agenda in North Korea was to reach agreement on the date, time and specific location for the summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. ìAnd the location is important. But there are many conditions that play into that. How long is it going to go on? When you say where, like really where? Not just a city or a country, but like really where?î Mr. Pompeo said. ìSo weíre trying to put some more meat on that.î Mr. Pompeo is widely expected to leave Pyongyang with three Americans now imprisoned in North Korea. All of them are Korean-Americans and all have the surname Kim, although they are not related. Asked whether he expected the North Koreans to release the three detainees to him, Mr. Pompeo said, ìI think itíd be a great gesture if they would choose to do so.î And asked whether a summit meeting was possible if the North Koreans continued to detain the Americans, he said, ìWeíre hopeful we donít have to cross that road.î Mr. Pompeo also stressed, as he has done on almost every occasion when publicly speaking about the summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, that the United States would not support a proposal by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea for step-by-step measures, in which the North Koreans would get sanctions lifted over a period of years as they gradually unwound their nuclear program. ìWeíre not going to relieve sanctions until such time as we achieved our objectives,î he said. ìWe are not going to do this in small increments, where the world is essentially coerced into relieving economic pressure.î Many analysts in South Korea and around the world believe that such an all-or-nothing strategy will fail with the North Koreans, but a senior administration official traveling with Mr. Pompeo pointed out that previous administrations had tried incremental measures, all of which failed to halt the countryís progress toward building a nuclear arsenal and the missiles to deliver them. The senior official said that Mr. Kim promised as recently as New Yearís Eve that the country would mass produce nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them, and that a year ago he had ordered the assassination of his half brother with the use of a chemical weapon. One goal of the trip, the official said, was to see whether the North was ready to take the steps needed to prove it had moved beyond such talk and actions."

Mr. Buhari, 75, left for London on Monday for a four-day visit, setting off renewed concerns about his health. His trip also comes after three weeks of strikes by health care professionals who are calling for better working conditions and more funding. For nearly two years, Mr. Buhari has been receiving treatment for an unspecified illness, which he has repeatedly refused to discuss. The president is scheduled to return to Nigeria on Saturday, at which point he will have spent more than 170 days in London on official medical leave since becoming president in 2015. Advertisement Mr. Buhari recently declared his intention to run for a second term next year, but many people in Nigeria, including some former presidents, have called on him to step down because of concerns about his health. After Mr. Buhari visited Washington to meet with President Trump late last month, he surprised reporters by not returning directly to Nigeria but instead making what his media team called a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>technical stopover‚<U+0080>ù in London. His aides later confirmed that he received medical treatment while in Britain. Mr. Buhari‚<U+0080><U+0099>s aides have insisted that the president is healthy and capable of running for office again, claiming that his political enemies are exaggerating any health concerns to attack him. In April 2016, months before his first medical trip to London, Mr. Buhari condemned the use of Nigerian resources on international medical expenses. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>While this administration will not deny anyone of his or her fundamental human rights, we will certainly not encourage expending Nigerian hard-earned resources on any government official seeking medical care abroad, when such can be handled in Nigeria, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Buhari said, according to a statement from the Health Ministry at the time.

During his campaign the president promised to end ‚<U+0080><U+009C>medical tourism, ‚<U+0080>ù the practice of Nigerian politicians receiving medical treatment abroad even as most citizens are forced to rely on underfunded state medical services. After what was reported to have been motorbike accident in January, the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s son, Yusuf Buhari, was also treated abroad, although the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s aides would not confirm where he was treated. Nigerians see Mr. Buhari‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions on health care as hypocritical, said Yemi Adamolekun, executive director of Enough Is Enough, a coalition of groups committed to building a culture of good government and public accountability in Nigeria. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s getting a superior standard of health care for himself and his son, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done virtually nothing to invest in health care infrastructure and provision in Nigeria, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Adamolekun said. This year Nigeria spent 3.9 percent of its budget on health care, a fraction of the 15 percent target set by the United Nations. Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Health professionals have been on strike now for three weeks, and they aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even talking about it, ‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Adamolekun said, referring to the government. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So we have poor health infrastructure, an exodus of qualified medical staff and now a strike with no conversation on how to fix it, yet our president jumps off to the U.K. for his own health.‚<U+0080>ù A nationwide strike of 72,000 public health care workers has crippled medical services in state hospitals across Nigeria, and many more are expected to join the protest in the next few days. Biobelemoye Josiah, president of a coalition of unions involved in the strike, said that health care in Nigeria had suffered under Mr. Buhari‚<U+0080><U+0099>s administration. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There has long been medical tourism because our hospitals are grossly underfunded and that has continued, ‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Josiah said.+"
193,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:07,5:00:01,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/books/review/rachel-kushner-mars-room.html,Rachel Kushnerís ëThe Mars Roomí Offers a Blackly Comic Take on Prison Life,"The authorís much-anticipated new novel, a page turner set in a womenís correctional facility, reveals an imagination Dickensian in its amplitude ó and in its reformist zeal.",Charles Mcgrath,Books,Lifestyle,"Books,,","THE MARS ROOMBy Rachel Kushner339 pp. Scribner. $27. Rachel Kushnerís second novel, ìThe Flamethrowers,î instantly established her as one of the most gifted writers of her generation ó on the same tier as Jennifer Egan and the two Jonathans, Franzen and Lethem. As the title suggests, it was a flamboyant book, brilliant to a point just short of showoffiness, and it somehow managed to fuse together sex, motorcycle racing, Italian labor strife and the New York art world of the 1970s. It made everyoneís Top 10 list, was a finalist for a 2013 National Book Award (I was one of the judges) and quickly got snapped up by the movies. Now we have her much-anticipated third novel, ìThe Mars Room,î and though it, too, has already been optioned, it couldnít be more different from ìThe Flamethrowersî ó or, for that matter, from Kushnerís first book, ìTelex From Cuba,î also an N.B.A. finalist. That was a historical novel about some American families living in Cuba in the mid-1950s, just before the Castro revolution. It was so earnest and evocative, so meticulously researched (with walk-on parts for Hemingway, both Castro brothers and Desi and Lucy), that it almost felt like a throwback. The one hint that the author might be up to something more original was a subplot involving an exotic dancer named Rachel K (no coincidence, surely), who turns out, like her novelist creator, to be both an illusionist and an observer who misses nothing. ìThe Mars Roomî is much smaller in scope than either of its predecessors, and seemingly more modest, with less swagger in the writing. Itís a page turner all the same, and in some ways more affecting than the other books. Itís a prison novel, of all things, set mostly in a place called the Stanville Womenís Correctional Facility, in Californiaís Central Valley, and except to readers who donít get Netflix, will immediately bring to mind the hit series ìOrange Is the New Black.î But Stanville is a much darker place than that showís minimum-security facility, and the novel is both more blackly comic and more knowing about prison life. You can learn from it how to communicate with another cell through the plumbing and how to brew pruno, or prison moonshine, or whip up a prison cheesecake using Sprite and nondairy creamer. Only the losers, the prisoners with no money, eat in the chow hall, it turns out; the rest dine in their cells on junk food and ramen noodles purchased from the commissary. The novelís main character is Romy Hall, a 29-year-old serving two life sentences, plus six years. I wonít reveal what lands her in jail, except to say sheís guilty but that there are extenuating circumstances ignored by her hapless, fumbling public defender. Romy is hardly an innocent, though. Growing up in the unfashionable Sunset District of San Francisco ó described in great detail by Kushner: the fog, the clamminess, the beach bonfires, the sticky-floored Irish bars ó she becomes an almost feral street kid, drinking, shoplifting, doing drugs and thinking about selling them, all before sheís barely pubescent. Romy is bright enough but drifts through high school getting high, and afterward makes her living by giving lap dances at a strip bar called the Mars Room, a place so seedy, she says, that ìif youíd showered you had a competitive edgeî and ìif your tattoos werenít misspelled you were hot property.î Except for an art teacher she takes up with for a while, her taste in men runs to dirtbags, and with one of them, the doorman at another strip bar, she has a child, Jackson, who is 7 when the novel begins. Heís a sweet, charming boy, and she loves him after her fashion, but is at best an indifferent mother. Jackson spends so much time fobbed off on a neighboring Hispanic family that he starts speaking Spanish. On what will prove to be her last Thanksgiving as a free woman, Romy parks him with a babysitter and spends the day with one of her Mars Room regulars. Part of Kushnerís achievement here is that she makes this character, for all her shortcomings, so appealing. Romyís narration darts around in a voice that is tough, cynical, a little defensive at times, but ruthlessly honest and without a trace of self-pity. She has some of the bruised sweetness of Denis Johnsonís alkies and junkies in ìJesusí Son.î That Romy is white makes her something of an exception at Stanville. (White prisoners, she says sarcastically, tend to be either drunken drivers or baby killers, and in fact she has a baby-killer roommate, the aptly named Laura Lipp, who never shuts up.) Many of the others, some of whom she eventually bonds with in a kind of extended prison family, come from even worse circumstances: You feel that they were practically programmed to wind up in jail. But Kushner imparts to them, too, a redemptive gloss of dignity and individuality. Romyís best friends are Conan, a trash-talking trans man so masculine-seeming that he gets sent to a male prison for a while; and the gentle, philosophical Sammy, so at home in prison that she invariably manages to be sent back there. She thinks of her paroles not as departures but as vacations. Some of Stanville life we get to see through the eyes of a character named Gordon Hauser. Except for the Fudds, as Conan calls the guards, heís one of very few non-prisoners in the book, but in his own way heís almost as confined. Heís a graduate-school dropout, who never finished a Ph.D. thesis on Thoreau, and after a stint as an adjunct at a community college settles into teaching G.E.D. classes in prison, because the moneyís better and it seems easier. Lonely and depressed, he commutes to Stanville from an isolated cabin in the Sierra foothills, where he spends way too much time studying the journals of Ted Kaczynski. Gordon is well-intentioned but morally a little obtuse ó a stand-in for the reader, perhaps ó and his gradual discovery of the mindlessness and injustice of prison life, especially on death row, is one of the bookís plot levers. Kushner says of the lifers: ìAll of them were people who suffered and along the way of their suffering they made others suffer, and Gordon could not see that making them suffer lifelong would accrue to justice. It added new harm to old.î The other thing driving the plot is the death, about halfway through, of Romyís mother, who though herself a lousy parent, has been taking care of Jackson, who is now catapulted into ìthe system.î Because she is no longer his guardian, legally speaking, Romy can find out nothing about him, and the more she is rebuffed by legalese and bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, the more she anguishes. ìThe Mars Roomî makes you share her frustration. Itís one of those books that enrage you even as they break your heart, and in its passion for social justice you can finally discern a connection between all three of Kushnerís novels. Both ìTelex From Cubaî and ìThe Flamethrowersî paid glancing attention to the downtrodden and the exploited: sugar-cane cutters in ìTelex,î Brazilian rubber gatherers and Italian factory workers in ìFlamethrowers.î In ìThe Mars Roomî the neglected become the focus, and itís apparent that Kushnerís imagination, almost Dickensian in its amplitude, also embraces some of Dickensís reformist zeal. In its small way, ìThe Mars Roomî does for prison what ìHard Timesî and ìNicholas Nicklebyî did for 19th-century education. ìThe Flamethrowersî was in love with speed and with anarchy, with moments ó during a strike, an urban riot, a New York City blackout ó when the rules are suspended and everything is up for grabs. ìThe Mars Room,î on the other hand, chafes against the slowness and sameness of time and the oppressiveness of a system that in the name of ìjusticeî dooms our poorest citizens to lives of incarceration. Itís not giving away too much to say that, like most good prison novels, this one ends with an escape. There are two, actually, one clearly based on Richard Matt and David Sweatís 2015 breakout in upstate New York. The other is a more bookish kind of escape, and culminates in a moment of transcendence achieved mostly by literary style and authorial sleight of hand. Itís eloquent and moving, but to me, at least, it seems a little forced and wishful. The rest of Kushnerís novel is so powerful and realistic you come away convinced that all such escapes are illusory, and that even for those who get out, prison is still a life sentence."

No Problem for the Surging Boston Red Sox,"The high-priced pitcher has gone to Boston for tests on his hand, but the team is thriving without him because of Rick Porcello and a red-hot offense.",Tyler Kepner,Sports,Sports,"Baseball, Red Sox, Yankees, David Price, Rick Porcello, Mookie Betts","Chris Sale is a spectator in the Bronx this week, just another guy who wishes he could play. ìItís Red Sox and Yankees ó thereís always going to be some want for this series,î Sale said on Tuesday. ìItís got a lot of everything, the history, two good teams playing well, one of the toughest divisions in baseball. Itís going to pop out to people.î It pops out so much that Major League Baseball is bringing the series to London next June. Alas, because Sale pitched for the Red Sox on Sunday, he will miss this edition ó like another star Boston left-hander, David Price. The Red Sox sent Price to Boston for tests after he cut short a bullpen session Sunday because of numbness in his pitching hand. ìWeíve been taking care of these guys from day one ó spring training, the first month of the season,î Red Sox Manager Alex Cora said. ìAnd as soon as I heard what was going on, I think weíre better off for him to see whatís going on, do more tests and go from there and make a decision.î Price felt the same sensation during his last start against the Yankees on a frosty April night at Fenway Park. He gave up four runs in one inning then, part of a five-start stretch in which his earned run average is 8.22. In theory, an injured or ineffective Price should be devastating to the Red Sox, who are paying him an average of $31 million per year through 2022. But he made just 11 starts last year and the Red Sox won the American League East ó and that was with Rick Porcello leading the league in losses (17), hits allowed (236) and homers allowed (38). Porcello will move up a day and start for Price on Wednesday (Eduardo Rodriguez goes on Thursday), and he is back to being one of baseballís best, with a 2.14 E.R.A. and an A.L.-best 9.2 strikeouts per walk. Porcello won the Cy Young Award in 2016 but has revamped his pitch mix since then, using more changeups and sliders than ever. His sinker ó a risky pitch in the age of the launch angle ó is better, too. ìHeís in that sweet spot now,î said Brian Bannister, Bostonís assistant pitching coach. ìHeís getting a lot of depth on his changeup and a lot of depth on his sinker.î The Red Sox backed off their startersí workloads in spring training, planning for October in February. In Bostonís four-game division series loss to Houston last fall, an exhausted Sale, Porcello and Drew Pomeranz lasted a combined 10 innings in their starts. The Astros hit .333 off the Red Sox in the series, and though they beat the Yankees in the next round, too, they hit just .187 in that series. The Astros (2.66), the Yankees (3.43) and the Red Sox (3.45) had the three lowest E.R.A.s in the American League coming into Tuesdayís games. All three teams should return to the postseason this year, but either the Yankees or the Red Sox will be consigned to a wild-card play-in game. As the season goes on ó especially if these teams remain as good as they look now ó that will create a layer of anxiety that never existed in the early 2000s, when the lone wild-card team was guaranteed to play in a division series. ìThatís definitely not going through my mind ó itís May, itís way too early,î said Bostonís J.D. Martinez, who played in the wild-card game last October for the Arizona Diamondbacks. ìObviously thereís a danger to it, because itís a one-game elimination. But itís fun. Thatís a game that is good for baseball. It makes it exciting.î Martinez, who signed in February for five years and about $110 million, led the majors in slugging percentage last season for Detroit and Arizona. He has helped the Red Sox recharge their lineup, plugging into the power they were missing last season, after David Ortizís retirement, when they hit the fewest homers in the American League. These Red Sox led the majors in slugging percentage before Tuesdayís game, at .460, with 13 homers from Mookie Betts and eight from Martinez. They also led the majors in doubles, with 85 ó six more than any other A.L. team (the Yankees are in third with 75) ó and were tied for sixth in homers, with 46. ìHome runs are cool, home runs are welcome,î said Cora, the Astrosí bench coach last season. ìBut one thing theyíre doing is doing damage with two strikes, which I saw last year firsthand with the Astros. Mookie did it at Fenway three times. And when you can do it like that with two strikes, I donít want to talk about momentum in baseball, but it seems like the opposition gets down a little bit when you can just keep the line moving.î Cora was referring to Bettsí second three-homer game of the season, which came last week at Fenway against Kansas Cityís Danny Duffy. Betts, who is 25, has four three-homer games in his career ó more than Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth combined. ìHe wants to get better every day,î Martinez said. ìHeís hungry for information. Iíve been around the game for seven years now, and you just donít see players of that caliber that want that. You see a lot of star players that have a lot of ability and think they know everything, and I donít feel like heís one of those.

The first time she turned him down, he sliced his face to ribbons with a piece of broken glass. The first time they kissed, he fainted dead away. Those would prove to be the good old days. In his six-volume autobiographical novel, ìMy Struggle,î Knausgaard documents their stormy marriage in pitiless detail: her rages, his resentments, their ecstasies of mutual recrimination. Their fights could have been scripted by Bergman. The books are so lavish with family secrets, they seem not shameless so much as an attempt to annihilate the very concept of shame itself. ìI married the worldís most indiscreet man,î Bostrom Knausgaard said in an interview in 2015. (The couple have since divorced.) On the face of it, Knausgaardís new project ó a series of books inspired by the seasons (the final one, ìSummer,î will be published later this year) ó has been a departure. Gone is the claustrophobia, the scouring self-scrutiny, the glacial creep of ìMy Struggle.î ìAutumnî and ìWinterî were full of quick sketches of the material world, prose poems on buttons and badgers, apples and faces. The books are all sunlight and unfettered sentimentality. But ìSpring,î the latest installment, translated from the Norwegian by Ingvild Burkey, is a return to form, and a return to ruthlessness. The book begins in a home where everything is leaking and creaking and on the verge of collapse. Every zipper is stuck, every button loose. The drains are clogged. The light bulbs have burned out long ago. So has the marriage. The kids are all right, though; glorious, in fact. Knausgaard watches his four children with awe. Their strong bodies, ìinfinitely more complex than any machine or mechanical device on the inside, had always functioned perfectly, had never broken down, had never gone to pieces.î Or have they? We learn that he was summoned to a meeting with child protection services. He doesnít say why; the mystery dangles like a lure. It becomes clear that it has something to do with the depression that engulfed his wife during her last pregnancy. The new series is addressed to Knausgaardís youngest child. ìI am 46 years old and that is my insight, that life is made up of events that have to be parried. And that the moments of happiness in life all have to do with the opposite,î he writes to her. ìThe opposite of parrying is creating, making, adding something that wasnít there before. You were not there before.î ìSpringî features Knausgaard unbound, writing for the first time without a gimmick or the crutch of extravagant experimentation, the endurance test of ìMy Struggleî or the staccato essays of his previous books on the seasons. ìSpringî refuses contrivance; it refuses to parry. Instead, over the course of one day, we watch Knausgaard care for the children and home, his wife mysteriously absent. He changes diapers, makes meatballs, desultorily enforces some discipline and does a harrowing amount of laundry. He sneaks off for a cigarette and writing time. And the bookís blunt, unforced telling brings the larger projectís meaning into sudden, brilliant focus. In ìMy Struggle,î Knausgaard offered a more complete portrait of his wifeís depression. She had attempted suicide shortly before they met. Her father also suffered mightily from mental illness. He was institutionalized for much of his life, and once tried to kill his family. Knausgaardís own father drank himself to death and kept a diary of his drinking while doing so ó ìit is as if he was logging his own demise,î Knausgaard wrote. ìThere are as many reasons for suicide as there are people who commit suicide,î he writes in ìSpring,î ìbut common to them all is that in one way or another they have become unattached, something other than attachment has gained the upper hand within them, making them unable to receive what the self needs to live.î This series is the rejoinder to his fatherís diary. Knausgaard has assembled this living encyclopedia for his daughter with a wild and desperate sort of love, as a way to forge her attachment to the world, to fasten her to it ó to fight the family legacy of becoming unmoored and alienated. Itís almost a matchmaking endeavor, so frantically does he tout the beauties of the world ó ìthe smell of wet snow in winter, fog in the dark of an autumn evening.î Fall in love with the world, he enjoins, stay sensitive to it, stay in it."

The victory by Mr. Cordray, who was endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and drew strong labor support, came as a relief to many Democrats who saw Mr. Kucinich as unelectable, given his sharply left-wing views and ties to a group sympathetic to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Cordray will compete this fall against Mike DeWine, the state attorney general, who claimed the Republican nomination after an aggressive challenge from Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor. In other major primaries Tuesday, Republicans in West Virginia and Indiana were choosing candidates to run for Senate in November against two vulnerable Democratic incumbents. The Indiana senator, Joe Donnelly, won renomination with no opposition. The West Virginia Senate primary race drew widespread attention in recent days as President Trump and other Washington Republicans came out hard against one of the partyís candidates, Don Blankenship, the former coal executive who served a year in prison in connection with a mining disaster in 2010 that claimed 29 lives. The winner will face Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat who enjoys some Republican support but will be running for re-election in a state that Mr. Trump carried by 42 percentage points in 2016. Indiana Republicans settled a bloody Senate primary between three largely indistinguishable candidates, selecting Mike Braun, a wealthy former state legislator and business executive, to challenge Mr. Donnelly, a first-term Democrat. Mr. Braun campaigned successfully as a political outsider, though his business record is likely to face closer scrutiny in the general election. ìWe seem to be in the era of the outsider, said John Hammond, a lawyer and member of the Republican National Committee from Indiana. ìThat message along with it being extremely well funded, he outspent the other campaigns two to one. Plus the basic message resonates with a lot of the Republican base in Indiana. They are looking for someone from the outside, not a part of the system to deal with a system that they think seems to be broken.î Mr. Trump is scheduled to campaign in Indiana against Mr. Donnelly on Thursday. And in a low-profile election distinguished only by a famous last name, Greg Pence, the vice presidentís brother, claimed the Republican nomination in Indianaís 6th Congressional District. Mr. Pence, who vacuumed up campaign funds from national donors close to his brother, is the strong favorite to win what was his brotherís old seat. In Ohio, Mr. Cordrayís victory in the Democratic primary marks an important initial success in his return to electoral politics after serving for most of a decade in the Obama administration. His success also demonstrated a show of strength for Ms. Warren and unions against the more far-left elements of the party, including some of Senator Bernie Sandersís allies who had endorsed Mr. Kucinich. (Mr. Sanders did not make an endorsement in the race.) Should Mr. Cordray win this November, it will give Democrats a foothold back in a battleground state that has been drifting to the right in recent years. A former Ohio attorney general who was defeated for re-election in 2010, Mr. Cordray became the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog agency set up after the 2008 economic meltdown to scrutinize Wall Street. He stepped down from the bureau late last year, months before his term was set to expire, in order to run for governor. Mr. Cordray faced stiff opposition in his political homecoming, most notably from Mr. Kucinich, a flamboyant 71-year-old former congressman and Cleveland mayor who is aligned with the far left. Despite collecting endorsements from powerful labor unions and campaigning alongside Senator Warren ó a hero to liberals ó Mr. Cordray struggled at times to inspire enthusiasm from rank and file Democratic voters. And after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February, Mr. Cordray agonized over having taken conservative stances on gun control in the past; he had even earned the endorsement of the National Rifle Association in 2010. Yet Mr. Cordray ultimately had far broader appeal than Mr. Kucinich, who also flailed in the final weeks of the race to explain his past praise of Mr. Trump and his decision to accept $20,000 from a group supportive of Mr. Assad. (After attempting to dismiss questions about the fee, he eventually returned the money.) Mr. Cordray will confront a tougher and more conventional opponent in Mr. DeWine. A longtime political hand in Ohio and Washington, Mr. DeWine is a powerful fund-raiser with a record of running toward the center in difficult elections. Mr. DeWine is likely to benefit, somewhat paradoxically, from both Mr. Trumpís strength in the state and the popularity of the outgoing governor, John Kasich, a Republican who ran against Mr. Trump in 2016 and is one of the presidentís most insistent critics. The burden will be on Mr. Cordray to show that his populist message and soft-spoken persona can resonate in a state where Republicans have held the governorship for all but four years since 1990. But the most closely watched race ó and, for Republicans, the most anxiety-inducing one ó was in West Virginia, where Mr. Blankenship threatened to again torpedo the partyís chances for success in a red-state Senate seat. President Trump had remained quiet about the primary race even as Mr. Blankenship began attacking Republican leaders, such as referring to the family of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Mr. McConnellís wife, as the majority leaderís ìChina familyî and calling Mr. McConnell himself ìCocaine Mitch.î But after a telephone call Sunday with Mr. McConnell, and on the advice of his own aides, Mr. Trump finally waded into the race with a Tweet Monday morning aimed at West Virginians. ìDon Blankenship, currently running for Senate, canít win the General Election in your StateÖNo way!î Mr. Trump wrote, before encouraging voters to support either of Mr. Blankenshipís opponents, Representative Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Mr. Trump also invoked the last time Republicans gave away a Senate seat by nominating a flawed candidate, an event that he suggested would live in political infamy. ìRemember Alabama,î he wrote, alluding to the partyís nomination of former state judge Roy S. Moore, who lost a special election after a series of women emerged to accuse him of making sexual advances on them when they were teenagers. Mr. Moore, though, had not served a prison sentence. Mr. McConnell on Tuesday would not discuss the attacks against he and his family, allowing that he would ìhave more to say on that tomorrowî should Mr. Blankenship win. The former chief executive of Massey Energy, Mr. Blankenship spent a year in federal prison after being convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety rules in connection with the Upper Big Branch mining disaster. Mr. Blankenship faced a series of attacks from Republican groups aligned with Mr. McConnell for his role in the explosion and was also criticized for keeping his official residence in Las Vegas and refusing to fully disclose his extensive financial holdings. But while Mr. Morrisey and Mr. Jenkins attacked one another, and a Democratic super pac assailed Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Blankenshipís poll numbers crept back up. That was in part because he dipped into his personal wealth to air a series of incendiary ads targeting Mr. McConnellís wife and in-laws. ìSwamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people,î Mr. Blankenship said in one commercial, alluding to the shipping business of Mr. McConnellís father-in-law. By last weekend, when it became clear that he was a threat to win and imperil the partyís one-seat Senate majority, Republican officials determined the moment had come for Mr. Trump to step in."

The league said Tuesday that was investigating the circumstances of the charges in accordance with the joint domestic violence policy between the league and the M.L.B. Players Association. The Toronto Police said Osuna would appear in court June 18, but would not provide more details. ìWe are aware of the incident involving Roberto and fully support the decision by the Commissionerís Office to place him on administrative leave,î the Blue Jays said in a statement. ìWe are taking the matter extremely seriously, as the type of conduct associated with this incident is not reflective of our values as an organization. ìAs this remains an ongoing investigation by Toronto Police, the club will not comment further on the matter.î Osuna, 23, is in his fourth major league season, all with the Blue Jays. A native of Juan Jose Rios, Mexico, Osuna has nine saves in 15 appearances this season with a 2.93 earned run average and 13 strikeouts. The Blue Jays started a six-game homestand Tuesday night against the Seattle Mariners. The team had planned to give away Osuna T-shirts to the first 15,000 fans attending the series finale on Thursday. The Blue Jays recalled the right-hander Jake Petricka from Class A Buffalo to take Osunaís spot on the roster. Major League Baseball and the Players Association agreed on a domestic violence policy in 2015. It allows the league to discipline a player accused in a domestic violence incident regardless of whether it results in a trial. Aroldis Chapman, currently with the Yankees, was the first player to be disciplined under the terms of the policy when the league suspended him for the first 30 games of the 2016 season for an accusation of domestic violence on Dec. 7, 2015. Days later, shortstop Jose Reyes was suspended for the first 51 games of the 2016 season after a claim of domestic violence."

Included in the price: a whiff of association with its previous owners, a couple whose names were synonymous with wealth, taste and privilege. The painting, along with dozens of other first-rate artworks and hundreds of pieces of furniture, ceramics, porcelain and knickknacks on sale this week, belonged to David and Peggy Rockefeller, potent symbols of New York society and formidable collectors and philanthropists. That provenance prompted vigorous bidding at the auction houseís Rockefeller Center headquarters on Tuesday; many of the 44 pieces went for well over the high estimate and seven set new auction highs for their artists, including for Matisse and Monet. ìWhat do you think the greatest name in America is for wealth?î said the art adviser Neal Meltzer. ìIn the 21st century we have a new form of sovereign wealth and those individuals can relate to this family.î Christieís is hoping this aspirational drive fuels sales that exceed $1 billion by the end of the week, a figure that would be a first for an auction. The Rockefeller auction, whose proceeds will go to various charities, comes on the heels of a history-making sale last fall at Christieís: Leonardo da Vinciís ìSalvator Mundiî for $450.3 million. The first real test of the power of Rockefeller was Tuesday night, an auction of 19th and 20th century art. The results were encouraging, totaling $646 million with fees ó the pre-sale estimate was $490 million ó and every lot sold. ìItís really fabulous,î said the collector Donald B. Marron, who referred to the worksí provenance as the ìRockefeller premium.î ìItís nice to see things that are modern, rather than contemporary, bringing good prices.î Jockeying for the rights to the auction started not long after Mr. Rockefeller, the last surviving grandson of the oil baron John D. Rockefeller, died last year at 101; Peggy Rockefeller died in 1996. Christieís defeated its rival Sothebyís by guaranteeing the Rockefellersí estate a minimum total price of $650 million, according to a person familiar with the terms of the deal. That is a large gamble for an auction house since it has to cover any shortfall, though Christieís was able to shift some of the risk to outside investors. The Picasso was the highest priced lot, with a pre-sale estimate of $100 million; the painting from the artistís Rose period held pride of place in Mr. Rockefellerís library. It was among a trove of artwork acquired from Gertrude Steinís estate in 1968 by a syndicate of prominent collectors that included Mr. Rockefellerís brother Nelson and the CBS chairman, William S. Paley. David Rockefeller drew first pick and chose the Picasso. But the 1905 canvas was by no means a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. Depicting a naked teenage girl with a basket of flowers, ìFillette ‡ la Corbeille Fleurieî is widely acclaimed but, given the cultural #MeToo moment, potentially discomfiting. Moreover, the painting is not immediately recognizable as a Picasso, given its figurative style. Sure enough, the bidding never took off for that top lot on Tuesday, despite the best and exceedingly patient efforts of the auctioneer, Jussi Pylkkanen. The hammer came down at $102 million, just over the estimate, with the total reaching $115 million with fees. The winning bid came in by phone. ìI think they overhyped what they thought it might bring,î said the dealer Larry Gagosian as he left the sale. ìItís all about managing expectations.î But Guillaume Cerutti, the chief executive of Christieís, said he was unfazed. ìWe thought it would go in the $100 million range ó itís O.K.,î he said. ìAt that level, itís difficult to predict.î And Almine Ruiz-Picasso, who owns the Almine Rech Gallery and is married to Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, a grandson of the artist, said she was not surprised the painting did not go for more. ìItís a very historical work,î she said. ìItís for a certain type of collector that is maybe more limited.î In 2015, Christieís sold the most expensive Picasso to date, ìLes Femmes díAlger (Version ëOí)î for $179 million. Another big prize of the evening, Matisseís 1923 ìOdalisque CouchÈe aux Magnolias,î a sensual nude on a green striped chaise, went for $80.8 million following an estimate of $70 million, with five phone bidders and two in the room driving the price to a new auction high for the artist. Although the demand for Impressionists has paled in comparison to the craze over contemporary art, the Rockefellerís holdings in this category nevertheless attracted several bidders. Monetís ìNymphÈas en Fleurî (ìWater Lilies in Bloomî), one of the artistís celebrated water lilies, generated some of the nightís stiffest competition. Fielding bids from several different places in the room and on the phones, Mr. Pylkkanen joked: ìItís like a tennis game with five rackets.î At the $71 million mark, he added, ìItís never too late to jump in.î The hammer came down at $75 million, and the $84.7 million sale price with fees was an auction high for Monet. Buyersí identities were not disclosed but Christieís said that some were institutions that will be announced at a later date. ìLive like a Rockefeller,î was Christieís pitch for the week of sales, betting on the idea that people would seek to take home some relic of American royalty, however small. The pieces had hung on the walls and decorated the rooms of the coupleís various homes. In addition to the multimillion dollar paintings in Tuesdayís evening sale, half of the Rockefeller material ó more than 1,500 lots ó was put online, making it available to a broad swath of people at varying price points. The items included a pair of silver salt and pepper shakers (estimated at $400 to $600); a covered porcelain tureen shaped like a carp ($8,000 to $12,000); a pair of aquamarine and gold cuff links in the shape of martini glasses that had already reached $6,000 online by Tuesday evening; and the dessert service that Napoleon took to his exile in Elba ($150,000 to $250,000). The sales at Christieís continue on Wednesday and Thursday, with online bidding ending on Friday. ìThis is the creation of the fantasy ó how a Rockefeller could live,î said Marc Porter, the chairman of Christieís Americas, in an interview before the sale. ìFor most of the world, itís about the glamour of it.î Christieís was also banking on Asian interest in blue-chip American fare ó premiering the saleís highlights in Hong Kong; mounting special marketing campaigns in China and Japan; and bringing paintings to collectors in Shanghai and Beijing. These efforts bore fruit on Tuesday night. The victorious bids for the Matisse and Monet were taken by Xin Li Cohen, the deputy chairman of Christieís Asia, indicating they came from Asia. For previews in New York, Christieís transformed its main sales room into a faux garden and aviary, with piped-in bird song, to conjure up the Rockefellersí home in Pocantico Hills, N.Y. and show off some of the porcelain pieces, many of which feature images of parrots, falcons and quails. Also on display was a sumptuous picnic spread, including the Rockefellersí English wicker hamper with settings for 12, a gift from King Hassan II of Morocco ($5,000 to $10,000)."

But the committee said it saw no evidence that the Russians had ultimately changed vote tallies or voter registration information. In a few states, however, Russian hackers were ìin a position to, at a minimum, alter or delete voter registration data,î the committee said. ìThese activities began at least as early as 2014, continued through Election Day 2016, and included traditional information-gathering efforts as well as operations likely aimed at preparing to discredit the integrity of the U.S. voting process and election results,î the senators wrote. The Intelligence Committee has been investigating Russiaís election interference campaign for well over a year now. The findings and earlier recommendations related to election security amount to its first public conclusions based on that work. Many of the committeeís findings have already been disclosed publicly, but they add new detail to the scope of the Russian efforts in states across the country and the continuing vulnerabilities of those systems. The senators found that the Russians targeted at least 18 states, and said that there is evidence that they also went after three others, scanning them for vulnerabilities. In six states, they went further, trying to gain access to voting websites, and in ìa small number of statesî actually breached election computer defenses. In those instances the intruders had the ability to change registration data but appeared unable to change votes, the report stated. The senators cautioned that other Russian attacks and breaches could have gone undetected. The report, which was unclassified, faulted the Department of Homeland Security for an initially slow response to the Russian meddling, but it added that cooperation with the states had greatly improved. The department said this week that 17 states have gotten or soon will get so-called risk and vulnerability assessments of their election systems, a weekslong evaluation that is the governmentís most thorough cybersecurity check. Before November 2016, only one state had been assessed. The department conducts less intensive weekly ìcyberhygieneî scans of election systems in 33 states. And it has granted federal security clearances to about 30 state election officials, removing at least some of the barriers to sharing information about future threats to election security. Lawmakers also succeeded in getting $380 million in a large spending bill in March for grants to states to improve their election infrastructure and bolster election security. The committee released a list of recommendations in late March to help secure American voting systems ahead of the midterm elections. Those recommendations included the adoption of voting machines with paper ballot backups to replace paperless or otherwise outdated ones, instituting routine vote audits and updating software systems. The senators also urged the Trump administration at the time to send a clearer message that it would not tolerate attacks on any election systems or the democratic process. In a public hearing the next day, senators pressed homeland security officials to move faster in enforcing key security measures such as the granting of security clearances to state election officials. The senators also sounded concerns on Tuesday about the shrinking number of voting-machine makers. The three largest vendors of voting equipment dominate the industry, and both the companies and their subcontractors that serve local election agencies are largely unregulated. That makes them and other vendors ìan enticing target for malicious cyberactors,î the Intelligence Committee wrote. A National Security Agency analysis leaked publicly last June concluded that Russian military intelligence launched a cyberattack on at least one maker of electronic voting equipment during the 2016 campaign, and sent so-called spear-phishing emails days before the general election to 122 local government officials, apparently customers of the manufacturer. The emails concealed a computer script that, when clicked on, ìvery likelyî downloaded a program from an external server that gave the intruders prolonged access to election computers or allowed them to search for valuable data. The agency said the Russians appeared to have targeted managers of voter-registration computer systems, and that it was unclear whether any of those systems were compromised. Separately, Alaska officials disclosed on Monday that one of the stateís election-related servers had been breached on Election Day 2016 by a hacker who apparently was unconnected to the Russians. The data on the server was not confidential and could not be changed, and the computer itself was unable to make outgoing connections via the internet, so the hacker was unable to rove elsewhere in the election network. The breach was first reported the day after the 2016 election by the website Cyberwar News, but it went largely unnoticed until state officials revealed it this week. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to write and release additional reports on American intelligence agenciesí assessment of the Russian efforts, the Obama administrationís response, the Russiansí use of social media, and lastly, possible coordination or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Senators have conceded that consensus on that final report may be difficult to reach. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the committeeís chairman, told reporters on Tuesday that the next report, on the intelligence assessment, could be out as early as next week."

At home, was the opposite true?",Jill Filipovic,Opinion,US,"MeToo Movement, Sexual harassment, Women's rights;Feminism, Women and Girls, Attorney general, Eric T Schneiderman, Tanya Selvaratnam","It hurts the most when itís one of the ìgoodî ones. The latest man to torpedo his own career is Eric Schneiderman, who resigned Monday evening from his position as New York State attorney general just hours after The New Yorker published a long piece detailing the myriad ways he is alleged to have abused some of the women in his life: hitting them, choking them, sexually degrading them, psychologically mistreating them and verbally undermining their work and their sense of self. At home, it seems, Mr. Schneiderman was a sexual sadist and manipulative misogynist. At work, he was a champion of womenís rights, investigating potential charges against Harvey Weinstein, appearing at events supporting reproductive freedom, and even writing a bill specifically to punish the same kind of strangulation he is said to have forced on some of his partners. How do we reconcile these two versions of a single man? It wasnít just that Mr. Schneiderman appears to have been a feminist in the brightness of day but a violent misogynist when the lights went down. The reality may be darker: that the power he derived from his role in progressive politics was intertwined with his abuse. He seems to have used his feminist-minded political work to advance his own career, to ingratiate himself with the women he would go on to harm, and to cover up his cruelties (Mr. Schneiderman denies that he was abusive, instead saying he engaged in consensual sexual role play). And while this is just one disturbing story, it cuts to the heart of the incongruities of being a progressive woman in 2018: Donald Trump, who boasted about sexually assaulting and degrading women, is the president; the rage and dismay brought on by his election has also meant that powerful men are finally being called to account. And yet that accounting has made clear that even the men we thought we could trust ó especially, perhaps, the ostentatiously good ones ó may not be quite what they seem. The symbiotic relationship between Mr. Schneidermanís public politics and his alleged private behavior is a difficult one to traverse, because on the surface they seem like opposites. Unlike Mr. Trump, whose misogyny has long been part of his celebrity persona and whose political platform is hostile to womenís rights, Mr. Schneiderman was, by appearances, a dedicated public servant who stood up for minorities and the underprivileged. Not only was his office investigating Mr. Weinstein, but it was defending young people facing deportation after being brought illegally to the United States as children and trying to expand voting rights in New York. Behind the scenes, Mr. Schneiderman, who was reported to drink heavily, is accused not only of physical violence, but also of injecting virulent misogyny and racism into the abuses he is said to have committed. Tanya Selvaratnam, who dated Mr. Schneiderman, told The New Yorker that part of Mr. Schneidermanís sexual abuse involved him calling her his ìbrown slave,î having her call him ìMaster,î and confirming that she was his property. Itís impossible to know what exactly was going on in Mr. Schneidermanís mind. But one has to wonder if his alleged actions were all part of the same pathological craving for the kind of ultimate power that makes one immune from consequence ó that he got off on the simple fact that he had the ability to physically hurt women while being perceived as their noble champion. What greater sense of authority than knowing that you can rupture a womanís confidence (and, reportedly, her eardrum) so thoroughly that she, upon your mandate, removes her tattoos, loses weight and comes back after youíve hit her; that you can physically overpower and injure women and then scare them out of reporting it; and that you can also convince the feminist and progressive establishments to crown you one of their greatest leaders and strongest advocates? A man who derives satisfaction from riding in as a white knight fighting for womenís rights while he secretly abuses women: Itís so tremendously narcissistic it seems almost fictional. Maybe, if the abuse allegations are true, Mr. Schneiderman had two separate lives, totally alienating his abusive self from his feminist one, and maybe he lives every day with the shame of that cognitive dissonance. Or maybe his feminist self is part of the bigger power play and he simply enjoys getting one over on all of us. He saw career gains as he worked with progressive womenís groups over the years, and his prominence rose along with the current swell of a feminist-minded anti-Trump resistance, kicked off by the Womenís March and seguing into #MeToo. He rode that wave, and the womenís movementsí coattails, into much more fame than a state attorney general typically enjoys. His work in the realm of reproductive rights ó and the praise he garnered from it ó is a stark example. Feminists push for reproductive freedoms so that women can have basic bodily autonomy and economic stability, but also so that we can be free to enjoy sex for pleasureís sake. Mr. Schneiderman promoted the rights of women to choose what we do with our own bodies, and then is accused of personally turning sexual interactions into violent, degrading acts done to his female partners. Mr. Schneiderman also seems to have used his feminist reputation as a tool to access the exact kind of women he apparently enjoyed breaking down, while his liberal bona fides made the women who say he mistreated them second-guess themselves, and stay quiet. According to one woman quoted in The New Yorker piece, Mr. Schneiderman told her that high-powered professional women want to be sexually dominated, and said: ìYeah, you act a certain way and look a certain way, but I know that at heart you are a dirty little slut. You want to be my whore.î Then, she says, he slapped her across the face, twice. She didnít report it because ìHeís a good attorney general, heís doing good things. I didnít want to jeopardize that.î So what are strong women to do if even the men who seem like good feminists might be misogynists, too? With right-wing men who oppose womenís rights, what you see is what you get. With these bogus male feminists, it can be crazy-making ó especially since women are so often taught to subsume our own doubts and even our own experiences if men tell us weíre interpreting things incorrectly. Of course we want men to champion womenís rights, and we shouldnít look skeptically on the men who stand up for all of us. But we should pause when we sense that men are performing feminism for kudos or influence rather than simply doing the right thing. Harvey Weinstein attended a gala for Planned Parenthood, where Hillary Clinton was also present, bid $100,000 on a painting ó and then reportedly never sent the money. Louis C.K. wrote some great feminist jokes, but never seemed willing to fully give up the misogynist ones. And outside of celebrity circles, men including Clay Johnson and Don Hazen (briefly my own boss) found great success in progressive organizing and media largely by promoting themselves and strong-arming perceived detractors; it was little surprise to learn from recent reporting that they allegedly also bullied, sexually harassed and demeaned the women around them. (Mr. Hazen denied most of the allegations.) We should look at the male feministsí relationship to power: Are they willing to cede and share some of what they have to qualified women, or do they use women as helpmeets and steppingstones for their own careers? When women challenge them, how do they react? ó are they respectful or resentful? When theyíre pushing for womenís rights, whatís more important to them: the result or the recognition? There is no way to divine whether or not a man is a secret abuser. If the allegations are true, then the former New York attorney general is surely not the last faux-feminist man to be outed as a vicious misogynist. But he could be the last one who might think that strutting his feminism in public will be enough to protect him if he exploits women in private."

As frequent diners know from sad experience, it is, in fact, possible to cook in an acclaimed restaurant without picking up any of the qualities that itís acclaimed for. Even when actual skills have been learned, they are not always obvious. Or, occasionally, theyíre all too obvious, and youíll catch somebody in a two-person kitchen trying to replicate dishes originally assembled by a team of 40. One interesting thing about Soogil Lim is that you can almost draw a straight line from his rÈsumÈ to whatís on the table at his four-month-old restaurant in the East Village, Soogil. Itís easy to spot the imprint of Hooni Kimís Hanjan, where he was the executive chef for four years. Mr. Lim lived in South Korea until he was 28, so what he learned at Hanjan was not how to make the countryís traditional food but how to rework it into appealing, contemporary small plates. Daniel, where he spent seven years and reached the rank of sous-chef, turns up in the French techniques Mr. Lim leans on, in the crisp presentations that carry an echo of nouvelle cuisine, in the tender braised short rib, in his fondness for foie gras and in his preference for skillfully modulating flavors rather than tossing umami grenades. Itís also apparent, when you look around the dining room, that in his earlier jobs Mr. Lim spent most of his time in the kitchen; the lineage you taste in his cooking doesnít show up in the design. Soogil (SOO-gil) doesnít evoke a rambunctious Korean pub the way Hanjan does. Nor is it a carpeted and tableclothed luxury liner, like Daniel. Under the guidance of Mr. Limís wife, Sasook Youn, the dining room has been done in what we now recognize as the all-purpose Modern Asian style ó a long banquette of blond wood against one wall, a dining counter facing another wall, and a long communal table with benches running down the middle, all of them sitting on a plank floor. A few framed prints by Suzy Taekyung Kim, a New York artist from South Korea, are suspended over the banquettes. French windows on the street can be thrown open if the weather ever cooperates. Hanging in the back is a curtain. Once in a while it parts just wide enough for Mr. Limís face to appear while he scans the tables. Sometimes they are full. They should be full all the time, because cooking like this does not just sprout up through every crack in the sidewalk, particularly at prices that, with one or two exceptions, donít go over $20. A good window into Mr. Limís mind is the bindaetteok appetizer. Usually these mung bean pancakes present as flat, starchy discs whose golden surfaces hint at crunchiness without actually delivering it. The ones at Soogil, fried in pork fat, have golden crusts like veal cutlets; by the time youíve speared a piece with some chopped kimchi and dunked it in the traditional dipping sauce, you have all the expected flavors, plus a formidable crunch to sweeten the deal. He tinkers with the glass noodle dish called japchae in less radical fashion. The noodles themselves, shaped into a swirl with crisp shreds of vegetables and oyster mushrooms, have drunk in more soy and sesame flavor than they typically do. And Mr. Lim seems to have tripled, at least, the amount of bulgogi, a point he emphasizes by mounding the meat over the noodles so it looks like a sloppy Joe missing its top bun. The care the kitchen pays to technique is obvious in the seafood dishes; Iíve never had one that wasnít perfectly cooked. Monkfish, which can come off as a rubber replica of some part of the anatomy Iíd rather not think about, gets wrapped in a cabbage or lettuce leaf, gently poached, and sliced into neat little wheels. Arranged over stir-fried vegetables in a sea of fermented chile sauce, itís terrific, and about as French as Korean cooking should be allowed to get. An almost silky consistency marks the mackerel that Soogil serves, nigiri-style, over wads of rice that have been seasoned with ssamjang (standing in for wasabi?) and wrapped in chard leaves. The tender Manila clams, squid and shrimp in the spicy tofu-seafood stew kept more of their natural juiciness than usual, although very firm shellfish isnít necessarily a defect in that dish. Mr. Lim herds all the soft tofu into a flan at the bottom of the bowl, rather than letting cubes of it fend for themselves in the broth ó a move that nicely heightens the contrast of tofu and chiles. The least Korean thing on the menu must be the foie gras terrine, and itís also one of the only disappointments, with its crumbly Melba toasts and washed-out green-plum jelly. A dish called nurungji gras is something else entirely: a fine seared hunk of foie gras laid over spinach and pickled mushrooms on a springy, crunchy sizzled rice cake. Slabs of pork belly are braised until the fat streaks are nearly liquid. Then theyíre given a meaningful sear and served alongside a stripe of a sauce Iíve never had before, made with fermented shrimp and green plums and fresh red peppers: spicy, salty, sour and hot. The dish that breaks the $20 barrier is the short rib. If youíve had Danielís braised short ribs, the tenderness and concentration will be familiar to you, although Soogilís version is pointedly suffused with soy rather than red wine. Underlining the French connection, this block of beef is served with carrots, potatoes and winter squash. If you eat it by yourself, you could make dinner of it. After which you should probably investigate something that goes by the name Jenga Tower. Cigarettes of fried dough, chewy like rice sticks, are stacked like a log cabin, then dusted with sugar and misugaru, the powdered grain and bean blend Koreans use as an instant breakfast drink. You pull out a stick at the time until the tower falls and brings down the scoop of honey-and-chestnut gelato balanced on top. The dining room could take a few lessons in balance from that dessert. The lights could be dimmed by a few clicks. The pop music, while not actively awful, is just odd enough to be subliminally distracting. Soogil canít seem to find the right tone for service, either. Some nights itís very familiar and on others, peculiarly fussy ó a server insisted on giving the book Iíd brought a chair of its own. These are minor snags, but sorting them out is tricky, especially for first-time restaurateurs. Somewhere in the middle is a relaxed, confident style that will match the spirit of Mr. Limís cooking.

202,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,5:00:21,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/business/tax-breaks-jobs.html,"When All Else Fails, Tax Incentives Probably Will, Too",State and local incentives to land new offices and factories rarely pay off. But they are one of the few tools for redeveloping old industrial cities.,Eduardo Porter,Business Day,Business,"Jobs, US Economy, US states, Manufacturing, Tax Credits Tax Deductions Tax Exemptions, Urban area, Racine Wisconsin, Economy","On its face, Wisconsin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s development policy looks somewhat unhinged. The $3 billion it offered to attract Foxconn‚<U+0080><U+0099>s $10 billion flat-screen-television plant to Racine, near the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s southeastern tip, is an outrageous price tag. New Jersey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s offer of $5 billion to lure Amazon to Newark ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which comes out at $100,000 for each employee the online retailer would bring to town ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is also pretty extravagant. Chicago‚<U+0080><U+0099>s $2 billion in incentives seems sensible only by comparison. Giveaways like these are often a waste of public money. Research on a program of corporate tax breaks in Texas found that 85 to 90 percent of the projects benefiting from such incentives would have gone forward without them. Even when tax breaks work and spawn new jobs, local residents gain little if anything. Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., estimates that eight of every 10 new jobs will be filled by outsiders. While the new workers will pay taxes, most of the revenue will be spent on public services for a growing population. And the incentives themselves will blow a hole in state and local budgets, draining resources that would be better invested in, say, public education. Advertisement So why does everybody do it? State and local government spending on tax incentives like those offered by Wisconsin and New Jersey has increased sharply since 1990, to about $45 billion in 2015, by Mr. Bartik‚<U+0080><U+0099>s count. It amounts to roughly all the money that state governments collect from corporate income taxes. Is this just about opportunistic politicians dipping into state coffers so they can be photographed cutting the ribbon at a spanking new factory? I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t doubt it. But I would also suggest another, more troublesome motivation: desperation. Fiscal incentives are one of few tools for cities like Racine and Newark to create jobs. Whether Racine or Newark, Indianapolis or Detroit, Decatur, Ohio, or Bethlehem, Pa., too many of the cities that built the United States into an industrial power through the first two-thirds of the 20th century still haven‚<U+0080><U+0099>t figured out how to recover from the blow that knocked them over in the third. Racine County, once a healthy manufacturing hub churning out household cleaners, radiators for Caterpillar rigs and the like, has spent a good part of the last 35 years in a funk. Since 1970 it has lost nearly a fourth of its factory jobs, while jobs over all have grown at less than half the national pace. Household incomes in the middle of the distribution have shrunk 14 percent, adjusted for inflation. It has plenty of company. A study by Alan Berube and Cecile Murray of the Brookings Institution that I wrote about last week looked at 185 urban counties of at least 50,000 people where manufacturing in 1970 accounted for at least one-fifth of all jobs. It found that 70 of the counties had failed to adapt to the economic transformations since then, and 62 of them were in the Northeast or the Midwest. Others have come to similar conclusions. In a report published on Tuesday, Mr. Bartik identifies 105 large labor markets of at least 200,000 people that rely heavily on manufacturing. Only 22 of them ‚<U+0080><U+009C>succeeded‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which means that job growth has been positive since 2000 and has exceeded the national pace since 2007. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coping With Adversity: Regional Economic Resilience and Public Policy, ‚<U+0080>ù Harold Wolman, an urban expert at George Washington University, and his three co-authors observe that much of industrial America has spent a good part of the last 40 years underwater. Of the 45 metropolitan areas in the Northeast, 27 have experienced what they call ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chronic distress‚<U+0080>ù since the late 1970s, with much slower job growth than in the country as a whole for an extended period. In the Midwest, 33 of 90 metropolitan areas have suffered the same fate. And fewer than half of these distressed areas have managed to snap out of their stagnation. This is a new problem for the American economy. Through the 1970s, the income gap between rich and poor regions narrowed significantly. It was rare to find areas of persistently high unemployment. Workers moved to high-wage areas. Investment flowed to poor places where wages were lower. Advertisement In the face of persistent stagnation across a broad swath of the country, economists are reconsidering their longstanding objection to place-based policies, directed at improving the conditions of a local economy. Lawrence H. Summers, once a top economic adviser to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and two colleagues from Harvard University note in a new paper that the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eastern heartland‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> roughly the states east of the Mississippi that are not on the Atlantic coast ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has consistently underperformed in terms of economic growth and employment.

Job growth has lagged, as has overall economic growth. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>America appears to be evolving into durable islands of wealth and poverty, ‚<U+0080>ù the authors conclude. And that raises a sort of intractable question: What is the appropriate policy tool to bring a decaying industrial island back to life? There are places that have somehow managed. In last week‚<U+0080><U+0099>s column I mentioned St. Cloud, Minn. Grand Rapids, Mich., also inspires optimism. As its auto-parts industry was falling apart, it pivoted to biotech, raising money from local philanthropists to attract the main campus of Michigan State University‚<U+0080><U+0099>s College of Human Medicine to town. Mr. Bartik argues that government initiatives can help to clean up environmentally damaged industrial sites, improve transportation infrastructure and train workers in the skills that local employers seek. So can offering technical assistance to help small businesses develop. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You need to invest in services that increase local businesses‚<U+0080><U+0099> productivity, ‚<U+0080>ù he told me. Count me with the pessimists. I agree with Mr. Bartik‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ultimate proposition. But I doubt that a new airport or a few new roads or some technical assistance for small businesses can achieve the productivity jolt that the Rust Belt needs. And no amount of training will work if there are no local jobs to be had. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A variety of things can make things somewhat better, ‚<U+0080>ù Professor Wolman told me, but ‚<U+0080><U+009C>explicit policies don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have much to do with whether you are going to be able to claw your way out of chronic distress.‚<U+0080>ù The grand solution ‚<U+0080><U+0094> of course ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is investing in human capital. Study after study finds that areas with more educated work forces perform better. They earn higher wages and are more nimble in adapting to economic change. Advertisement But ‚<U+0080><U+009C>invest in education‚<U+0080>ù is hardly a prescription that Racine can simply pick up and run with. Indeed, solutions are easier to state than to carry out. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Chronically distressed regions need to regenerate through diversification, entrepreneurship and innovation, ‚<U+0080>ù Professor Wolman and his co-authors argue. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But these are more aspirations than strategies or policies.‚<U+0080>ù The old expectations of the industrial heartland ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about wages and benefits, about career ladders and job stability ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are no longer valid. The region‚<U+0080><U+0099>s social contract, which promised a decent job to anybody who wanted one, has been ripped up. But nothing has yet been put in its place. As decrepit industrial enclaves wait for some new deal to replace the yanked promises of their glory days, one might forgive the billion-dollar incentives with which they try to recapture their lost prosperity. As Professor Wolman put it, incentives might be a bad idea from the standpoint of overall welfare. But ‚<U+0080><U+009C>if I were a state government, ‚<U+0080>ù he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would be trying like mad to attract Amazon.‚<U+0080>ù Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo A version of this article appears in print on May 9, 2018, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Tax Breaks to Draw Jobs: A Bad Option, and Often the Only One.

Rybka, whose pseudonym means ‚<U+0080><U+009C>little fish, ‚<U+0080>ù is a prolific Instagrammer, a teacher of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sex workshops‚<U+0080>ù and the author of a how-to book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?‚<U+0080>ù She became famous in Russia this year for having chronicled, on Instagram, her 2016 affair with one particular billionaire, Oleg Deripaska. A few weeks later, she caught the world‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attention after she was arrested in Thailand in the middle of a sex workshop and then claimed, from the back of a police van, that she possessed information that could blow the investigation into Russian meddling in the American presidential election wide open. This strange story included an intriguing detour into the recent history of United States foreign policy. One of Rybka‚<U+0080><U+0099>s initial posts on the Deripaska affair was a short audio clip from a conversation that took place on the oligarch‚<U+0080><U+0099>s yacht in August 2016. As they sailed off the coast of Norway, Rybka and Deripaska were joined by an influential Kremlin official named Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko, and in the clip, Deripaska, who made his fortune during the violent aluminum wars of the 1990s, explains some things about geopolitics to Rybka, who was 26 at the time. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our relations with America are bad, ‚<U+0080>ù Deripaska says. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why? Because the person in charge of them is Sergei Eduardovich‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+0098>friend‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Nuland is what she is called. When she was young ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about your age ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she spent a month living on a Soviet whaling vessel. Ever since then, she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hated our country.‚<U+0080>ù Deripaska was referring to Victoria Nuland, a longtime American government official and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Russia hand, ‚<U+0080>ù as Russia experts are sometimes known, who at the time of the video was assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. Nuland had in fact, as Deripaska said, spent time aboard a Soviet vessel (fishing, not whaling) in the mid-1980s; whether she hated Russia ever after is a subject of some dispute. She spent three decades in various posts in the State Department and the White House. In 2013, as a newly confirmed assistant secretary of state, she became the point person for the increasingly fraught situation in Ukraine, where large protests against the president, following his decision to pull out of an economic agreement with the European Union, eventually led to his ouster. Early in the protests, Nuland was filmed handing out sandwiches, pastries and cookies to the demonstrators in what some viewed as a provocative show of solidarity. Later, as the government began to totter, she made a call that was intercepted and leaked online, most likely by Russian intelligence, in which she discarded the notion of working with the E.U. to resolve the crisis. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>[Expletive] the E.U., ‚<U+0080>ù she memorably said. What was remarkable about the episode was the utter confidence with which Nuland seemed to speak for the United States and its policy. From the start of his administration, President Barack Obama had tried to lower tensions with Russia and refocus American attention on a rising China; he had made clear he wanted no part in the problems of the post-Soviet periphery. Yet in the middle of the uprising in Kiev, there was Nuland, encouraging protesters and insulting European allies. And after the call leaked, it was Nuland, as much as Obama, who came to personify American policy for everyday Russians ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to the point that a professional sex coach like Rybka knows more about her biography than all but a handful of Americans. During two decades, on and off, reporting in Russia and the post-Soviet states ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in the turbulent ‚<U+0080><U+0099>90s, the wealthy but depressing aughts and finally during the eruption of violence in Ukraine ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I occasionally heard people talk about how ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Americans‚<U+0080>ù wanted this or that political outcome. The events in Ukraine demonstrated, or seemed to demonstrate, that behind the visible facade of changing presidents and changing policy statements and changing styles, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Americans‚<U+0080>ù were actually a small core of officials who not only executed policy but also effectively determined it. The continuing wars in Ukraine and Syria, the apparent Russian campaign of targeted assassinations on foreign soil, the widening gyre of sanctions and countersanctions and the still-festering question of Russian meddling in the 2016 election have made for the worst relations between the two countries since the 1980s. Understanding how to get out of this mess will require understanding how we got into it. There may be no better place to start than with the people inside the American government who have been working on the subject since 1991 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Russia hands. The abiding mystery of American policy toward Russia over the past 25 years can be put this way: Each administration has come into office with a stated commitment to improving relations with its former Cold War adversary, and each has failed in remarkably similar ways. The Bill Clinton years ended with a near-catastrophic standoff over Kosovo, the George W. Bush years with the Russian bombing of Georgia and the Obama years with the Russian annexation of Crimea and the hacking operation to influence the American election. Some Russia observers argue that this pattern of failure is a result of Russian intransigence and revisionism. But others believe that the intransigent and unchanging one in the relationship is the United States ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that the country has never gotten past the idea that it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>won‚<U+0080>ù the Cold War and therefore needs to spread, at all costs, the American way of life. Advertisement Last summer, a few months after the inauguration of President Trump, I began traveling to Washington to speak with Russia hands: those who had worked on Russia inside the State Department, the National Security Council or the Department of Defense. I interviewed hands who served in the government as far back as Jimmy Carter and up to the current administration; some served Republican presidents, others served Democrats, but a vast majority served both parties. The government, as a rule, discourages specialization: Military officers and diplomats are constantly transferred from one post to another, from one region to the next. Still, specialists do emerge. Many but not all Russia hands have Ph.D.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in Russian history or political science or security studies. Others got their graduate education on the job. Nuland worked on the Soviet fishing trawler; Daniel Fried, her eventual close collaborator at the State Department, spent a semester as a live-in babysitter for an American Embassy family in Moscow. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Seeing Communism up close cures you of all your left-liberal illusions that the Cold War is a misunderstanding that can be cured through arms control and d√©tente, ‚<U+0080>ù Fried says. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Communism up close is very ugly.‚<U+0080>ù Some Russia hands started out as civil servants or military officers, others as academics pulled into government service after working as advisers on political campaigns. The Russia hands have clear generational characteristics. Those who came of age at the height of the Cold War worked on Russia because it was America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most important foreign-policy problem. Many of those who finished graduate school or officer-training school in the late ‚<U+0080><U+0099>80s or early ‚<U+0080><U+0099>90s bear the scars of having studied a subject that became seemingly irrelevant overnight. In 1989, Peter Zwack, now a retired brigadier general, was a young military-intelligence officer stationed in Germany, taking Russian language and politics courses. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was waiting for them to come through the Fulda Gap, ‚<U+0080>ù he says, referring to a section of West Germany through which NATO planners expected the Soviets to push large mechanized formations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We were outmanned. I thought we were outgunned.‚<U+0080>ù But the Soviets never came, and for the next 20 years Zwack worked in the Balkans, then Afghanistan and South Korea, before finally returning to Russia in 2012 as defense attach√© to the American Embassy. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States had to staff 14 new embassies in the post-Soviet republics. Many of the Foreign Service officers who emerged from these postings did so with a somewhat jaundiced view of Russia. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When you start looking at the Russians by the people who have been visited by the Russians, ‚<U+0080>ù says Fried, who spent a fair amount of time in Poland during his long career in the Foreign Service, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>you tend to see it a different way.‚<U+0080>ù Finally, there is the younger generation, those 40 and under. These Russia hands are for the moment a rarer species. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you were an ambitious young Foreign Service officer after 9/11, you wanted to get sent to some reconstruction team in Afghanistan or Iraq, ‚<U+0080>ù says Andrew Weiss, who worked on Russia at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration and now runs the Russia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You wanted to learn Arabic. If you were ambitious, you did not want to go to the embassy in Ukraine.‚<U+0080>ù As in other foreign-policy sectors, the Russia hands divide less along party lines than along foreign-policy philosophies: They are either ‚<U+0080><U+009C>realists‚<U+0080>ù or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>internationalists.‚<U+0080>ù Realists tend to be cautious about American overseas commitments and deferential toward state sovereignty; internationalists tend to be more inclined to universalist ideals like democracy and human rights, even where these are forced to cross borders. But the two supposed categories are blurred by a thousand factors, not least of which being that realists don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t like being called realists, because it suggests that they have no values, and internationalists don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t like to be called internationalists, as opposed to realists, because it suggests that they have no common sense. In the end, a vast internationalist middle, consisting of neoconservative Republicans and interventionist Democrats, predominates, with tiny slices of hard realists on the right and soft realists, or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>neorealists, ‚<U+0080>ù on the left. And there are many shades of difference among all these people. The longtime Russia hand Stephen Sestanovich, a veteran of the Reagan and Clinton administrations, says there are two kinds of Russia hands ‚<U+0080><U+0094> those who came to Russia through political science and those who came to it through literature. The literature hands, he suggests, sometimes let their emotions get the best of them, while the political-science hands, like Sestanovich, are more cool and collected. Fried, who served in every administration from Carter to Obama, also thinks there are two kinds of Russia hands, though he draws a different dividing line: There are those, like himself, who ‚<U+0080><U+009C>put Russia in context, held up against the light of outside standards and consequences.‚<U+0080>ù These people tend to be tough on Russia. And then there are those ‚<U+0080><U+009C>who take Russia on its own terms, attractive and wonderful but subject to romanticization.‚<U+0080>ù These people tend to give Russia what Fried would consider a pass. Then there are those, like Michael Kofman, a young Kiev-born military analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlington, Va., who say that there only appear to be two kinds of Russia hands. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are the nice missionaries who knock on your door and say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Hey, have you heard the good news about democracy, freedom and liberalism?‚<U+0080><U+0099> And then there are the crusaders who are trying to claim the heathen Eastern European lands for democracy and freedom. But they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re basically the same person; they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re two sides of the same coin.‚<U+0080>ù Advertisement There are two kinds of Russia hands, or maybe there are six kinds of Russia hands, or maybe there is an infinite variety of Russia hands. And yet the mystery is this: After all the many different Russia hands who have served in the United States government, the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s relations with Russia are as they have always been ‚<U+0080><U+0094> bad. The Cold War ended with a bang in the U.S.S.R. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> new countries were forged, the ghosts of the past were confronted, a McDonald‚<U+0080><U+0099>s opened in Moscow‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pushkin Square. In the United States, there was also much hope. A sometime Russia hand named Francis Fukuyama, then deputy director of policy planning at the State Department, even wrote an essay in which he wondered if we were entering a new post-historical era, when the great questions of how to order society had been settled and all would live in a stable, if boring, peace. The first high-level Russia hand of the post-Cold War era was a man named Nelson Strobridge Talbott III, or Strobe for short. The scion of a prosperous Ohio family (his grandfather, the first Nelson Strobridge Talbott, was captain of the Yale football team in 1914), Talbott followed his forefathers to Yale, where he studied Russian literature and won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford. There he found himself rooming with a wonky, gregarious Georgetown graduate named Bill Clinton. Talbott remained interested in Russia, writing his master‚<U+0080><U+0099>s thesis on Mayakovsky, translating Nikita Khrushchev‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memoirs and then becoming a foreign correspondent ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and eventually a columnist ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for Time magazine. He was the first journalist to track down and interview Joseph Brodsky upon his exile to the West in 1972. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Looks like we lucked out, ‚<U+0080>ù Brodsky wrote in his diary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s read me.‚<U+0080>ù Talbott‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fundamental view of the U.S.S.R. was that it could be reasoned with; in the pages of Time, he regularly praised the virtues of arms control and d√©tente, and was despised for it by more ardent Cold Warriors. When Clinton was elected president, Talbott came on to advise his old roommate on what Clinton believed to be his most pressing foreign-policy concern: the transformation of Russia into a viable, American-friendly democracy on the eastern edge of Europe. Things did not turn out that way, and most of the reasons were internal to Russia. But the United States was not without its share of blame. The economic advice dispensed by the gurus of what was known as the Washington Consensus weakened an already vulnerable Russian state. Average Russian citizens saw their living standards and life expectancies drop. It was Talbott who offered one of the pithier critiques of the doctrine known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>shock therapy‚<U+0080>ù: What the Russian people wanted, Talbott said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was less shock and more therapy.‚<U+0080>ù The remark led to one of the stormiest passages of his political career. But he weathered it. During his tenure, the United States made one of the most momentous foreign-policy choices of the post-1991 era: the decision to expand NATO eastward, first into the former countries of the Warsaw Pact, then into the former republics of the Soviet Union itself. Talbott at first was opposed, or at least, as he now puts it, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>deeply riven.‚<U+0080>ù On one hand, the Eastern European countries, some of which were now led by heroic former dissidents, wanted very much to join the military alliance; on the other, the Russians warned Talbott ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>with a mirthless smile, ‚<U+0080>ù as he later recalled ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that NATO was to them a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>four-letter word.‚<U+0080>ù If the Cold War was really over, as the Americans kept saying it was, why expand a Cold War military alliance set up expressly to deter and contain the Soviet Union? But as much as Talbott loved Russia, there were clear advantages to securing the West‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gains. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the leadership of a country has any view but the following, ‚<U+0080>ù Talbott told me last summer, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not going to be the leadership of that county for very long. And that is: We do what we can in our own interest.‚<U+0080>ù But the NATO question, Talbott admitted, was complicated. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Should we have had a higher, wiser concept of our real interests that would require us to hold back on what many people would say is our own current interest?‚<U+0080>ù At the time the debate was taking place ‚<U+0080><U+0094> 1993 and 1994 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> much of the State Department and the Pentagon took the anti-expansion view, arguing that it would needlessly antagonize Russia at a difficult moment in its post-Communist journey and that the alliance was unwieldy enough without incorporating three fledgling Eastern European democracies (not to mention, eventually, Romania). But there were some who disagreed. A small working group at RAND produced a report arguing for NATO expansion as key to the future of Eastern Europe. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We talked to the Poles, and they said: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>If you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t let us into NATO, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re getting nuclear weapons. We don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t trust the Russians, ‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0089>‚<U+0080>ù one of the report‚<U+0080><U+0099>s authors, a former Air Force officer and Pentagon strategist named Richard L. Kugler, told me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Then we talked to the Germans. They said: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>The line of contact with the Russians now runs through Warsaw. If you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t defend it, we will.‚<U+0080><U+0099> We had a vision of a nuclear-armed Poland being fortified by German troops facing off with the Russians ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think anyone wanted that!‚<U+0080>ù The report was laughed at and rejected in some quarters ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a State Department official supposedly threw it in the trash in front of one of its authors ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but Fried, then at the National Security Council, started using it to lobby inside the administration for a more robust approach to expansion. Talbott initially resisted, but he and Clinton soon came around. The decision on NATO was essentially made by early 1994, but it would take some years before the first countries joined the alliance, and in the meantime, relations between Russia and the United States steadily declined: Russia was angered by the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions in 1995, by the American insistence that the Russians stop the sale of nuclear technology to Iran and especially by the 1999 NATO bombing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> just a few weeks after the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland finally joined the alliance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> of Belgrade. That conflict almost expanded when a small contingent of Russian troops seized the Pristina airport in Kosovo. If a British officer named James Blunt had not refused to act on an order from Gen. Wesley Clark to clear the airport, things might have turned out a lot worse. Blunt went on to fame as a rock musician with the hit song ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re Beautiful, ‚<U+0080>ù but the Russia-United States relationship remained precarious. The damage, in any case, was done. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We were so excited about the spread of democracy and the collapse of Communism, ‚<U+0080>ù says Olga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There were all these countries saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Yes, please, take us into NATO with weapons that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll give us to defend ourselves from the Russians, who are going to be coming like they always do.‚<U+0080><U+0099> And we said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Well, the Russians aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t coming, but yes, please, join us in democracy.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Advertisement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the Russians took it as a sign that we were still against them. It was really hard to walk back from. From there on out, we were doing things that we kept saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not doing this to hurt you, ‚<U+0080><U+0099> and that the Russians felt hurt them. We didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do it because we wanted to hurt them. We did it because we didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care if it hurt them.‚<U+0080>ù In the case of the centrist, Democratic Clinton administration, you might say that it was always going to be torn between hard internationalists like Fried and soft internationalists like Talbott. But what about the George W. Bush administration, which staffed itself with self-described realists? The answer turned out to be: more of the same. The main Russia hand in the Bush White House was Thomas Graham, a quiet, intense, scholarly former State Department official who was described by a colleague as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the smartest Russia hand ever produced by the Foreign Service.‚<U+0080>ù Graham was known for his prickly independence. As a political officer at the United States Embassy in Moscow in the 1990s, he became so frustrated with the White House‚<U+0080><U+0099>s approach to Russia that he published a repudiation of it in a Russian newspaper, under his own name. But on Graham‚<U+0080><U+0099>s watch, the relationship soured even more. The United States invaded Iraq despite Russian objections; vocally supported the popular uprisings in Georgia and Ukraine, known as the Rose and Orange Revolutions; and then, in Georgia, gave moral and material support to the flamboyantly anti-Russian administration of Mikheil Saakashvili, who in turn sent troops to the NATO mission in Afghanistan and the coalition in Iraq. Factors external to Russia played a role here: The Sept. 11 attacks refocused American foreign policy around counterterrorism. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We had a long period of inattention because of the war on terror, ‚<U+0080>ù Weiss says. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was a long period where anyone who banged his fist on the table and said: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Mr. President! Mr. President! Drop everything you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing killing bin Laden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inner circle! We need to talk to you because Vladimir Putin is mad about blah blah blah!‚<U+0080><U+0099> You can imagine how that did not rate.‚<U+0080>ù But it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t just the fight against terrorism. The Soviet Union‚<U+0080><U+0099>s collapse and Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s subsequent weakness reconfigured the entire process of American decision-making. When I asked Graham about the decline in relations on his watch, he delivered a soliloquy about bureaucracy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The way the N.S.C. is structured, ‚<U+0080>ù he began, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the way the State Department is structured, is through a series of regional and functional bureaus. The question is always, Who takes the lead?‚<U+0080>ù In Soviet times, when the entire foreign policy of the United States was oriented around countering the Soviet threat, the Russia hands frequently took the lead. In the post-Soviet era, with an increasingly irrelevant Russia, the reverse was true. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Russia was unique in that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a country that was a factor in almost all the major things the U.S. government did, but it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t in any place the most important factor. So you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re working on missile defense: Russia is clearly an important player in missile defense. But that process is not led by the person who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s responsible for Russia policy; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s led by the person who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s responsible for nonproliferation policy. If you come to energy, Russia is obviously an important player in global energy markets, but Russia is not the most important player in global energy markets. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the Saudis and OPEC. So when you come to an energy issue, the people who are in charge of energy run that.‚<U+0080>ù The same was true of the states of the former Soviet Union, which were now independent and the province of different regional desks at the State Department and the N.S.C. The most damaging episode in United States-Russia relations during Graham‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time at the N.S.C. was American cheerleading for the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in late 2004 and early 2005. Graham argued that the Russians saw the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>color revolutions, ‚<U+0080>ù as the Rose and Orange Revolutions were known, as an outgrowth of American policy and feared that regime change would be coming to Russia next. But freedom was on the march, Graham was told: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>‚<U+0080><U+0089>‚<U+0080><U+0098>All we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing is promoting democracy.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0089>‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re the Russia expert, ‚<U+0080>ù I said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But Ukraine is not a Russia issue, ‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a Ukrainian issue. There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a bureau for European affairs that overseas Ukrainian issues.‚<U+0080>ù During the Orange Revolution, the Europe desk at the N.S.C. was run by Fried. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My main contribution, ‚<U+0080>ù Graham summed up, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was preventing things from being worse than they could have been.‚<U+0080>ù Graham left government in 2007. Fried, his sometime nemesis, had become assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia and continued to push vocal American support of Western-leaning governments in former Soviet states, Georgia in particular. Nuland was the American ambassador to NATO. In April 2008, at a NATO summit meeting in Bucharest, the alliance announced over strong Russian objections that it intended to eventually admit Georgia and Ukraine. Four months later, deteriorating security conditions in South Ossetia, Georgia, provoked an emboldened Saakashvili into an attack on the breakaway region. Russian forces intervened, crushing the Georgian Army in less than a week. Advertisement The Georgian debacle ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in which a non-NATO American ally was defeated by Russia and the United States was left with no plausible response ‚<U+0080><U+0094> represented a low point. But the relationship was about to get much worse. The next president, Barack Obama, was the rare American politician with a sense of the fallibility of American power. He opposed the Iraq war and spoke honestly about the crimes of the American empire. Yet he was also divided in his mind. A realist in most of his foreign-policy leanings, Obama chose as his chief Russia hand a Stanford political-science professor named Michael McFaul. McFaul had spent years visiting Russia and writing about it. He was a Russophile, an advocate of more cooperative relations and a critic of the Bush administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unilateralism: in all this, a good fit for Obama. But he was also an avid internationalist and democracy promoter, who had speculated in a widely circulated 2005 essay on the seven ‚<U+0080><U+009C>factors for success‚<U+0080>ù required for color revolution ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the implication being that more such revolutions were necessary and desirable. In 2008, McFaul proposed a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>reset‚<U+0080>ù in relations between the two countries. This became the administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy, and for a while it worked. A new arms-control agreement was negotiated. Dmitri Medvedev, who succeeded Putin as president in early 2008, toured Silicon Valley. Russia joined the World Trade Organization. And a sprawling supply chain, called the Northern Distribution Network, was established to move supplies through Russia to NATO troops in Afghanistan. The existence of an alternate route gave the United States some leeway in its dealings with Pakistan. When Pakistan cut off the supply route in Afghanistan not long after the assassination of Osama bin Laden, NATO simply sent more through Russia. But relations with Russia soon soured. The more liberal Medvedev years created an expectation on the part of some Russians that the country would open up; when Medvedev announced in 2011 that he was stepping aside, that Putin would be returning to the presidency and that this is what they had planned all along, there was a feeling of grievous disappointment. Three months later, spurred by a number of blatant falsifications in the national Duma elections, this disappointment erupted into the largest protests of the post-Soviet period. Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, voiced approval for the protests and expressed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>serious concerns‚<U+0080>ù about the voting irregularities. Her comments fed the Kremlin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fears that the United States was somehow behind the demonstrations. McFaul, who arrived as ambassador to Russia in the midst of the protest wave, inflamed the situation further by taking a meeting with opposition leaders. He was never forgiven by the Russian authorities, who proceeded to harass him and his family and denounce him whenever possible as a foreign spy. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the words of Paul Stronski, a Russia hand who joined the N.S.C. in 2012: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was brought in to do reset, Part 2. Instead, I got Magnitsky, Snowden and Ukraine.‚<U+0080>ù Magnitsky was the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on individuals engaged in human rights violations and corruption and was inspired by the death in prison of a Russian tax attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, who was arrested after uncovering a huge corruption scheme. Snowden was Edward Snowden, who turned up in Moscow after orchestrating perhaps the most significant leak of American government documents since the Pentagon Papers. And Ukraine was, of course, Ukraine. Ukraine was a catastrophe two decades in the making. Its government was as corrupt and ineffectual as any in the post-Soviet space; it produced neither oil nor gas to serve as a financial cushion, and it was divided between a Russian-leaning east and a Europe-leaning west. To make matters worse, it was also the host, at Sevastopol, of the Russian Black Sea fleet, whose long-term lease, during times of tension, tended to become a political football. In the summer of 2013, with the shock of Snowden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s turning up in Moscow still fresh, Russian officials started making noise about an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>association agreement‚<U+0080>ù that Ukraine was about to sign with the European Union. To the Russians, the proposed agreement was a rejection of their own cherished customs‚<U+0080><U+0099> union, the Eurasian Economic Union, as well as a concrete step toward European integration for a country with which it had profound, centuries-old connections. And European integration, the Russians believed, would eventually mean NATO membership: hostile troops on the Russian border and an end to the lease for the Russian fleet. McFaul, still in Moscow, was one of the people to whom the Russians took these complaints. By his own account, he was dismissive of their concerns. First of all, he said, it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s business what Ukraine signed or didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sign. And second, he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think the Russians should get all worked up. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re talking about an association agreement, ‚<U+0080>ù he told me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expansion of the E.U. maybe in the year 2040, 2050? Ask the Turks about their association agreement.‚<U+0080>ù (Turkey signed a similar agreement with the E.U. in 1963 and still has not become a member.) It was just a piece of paper. But the Russians didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to think so. And neither, i"
204,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,19:44:21,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/trump-courageous-iran-decision.html,A Courageous Trump Call on a Lousy Iran Deal,Now weíll see whether the administration is capable of following through.,Bret Stephens,Opinion,Domestic Politics,"US Foreign Policy, Embargoes Sanctions, Nuclear weapon, US Politics, Nuclear weapons testing, Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump, Iran, Israel","Of all the arguments for the Trump administration to honor the nuclear deal with Iran, none was more risible than the claim that we gave our word as a country to keep it. ìOurî? The Obama administration refused to submit the deal to Congress as a treaty, knowing it would never get two-thirds of the Senate to go along. Just 21 percent of Americans approved of the deal at the time it went through, against 49 percent who did not, according to a Pew poll. The agreement ìpassedî on the strength of a 42-vote Democratic filibuster, against bipartisan, majority opposition. ìThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J.C.P.O.A.) is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and it is not a signed document,î Julia Frifield, then the assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, wrote then-Representative Mike Pompeo in November 2015, referring to the deal by its formal name. Itís questionable whether the deal has any legal force at all. Build on political sand; get washed away by the next electoral wave. Such was the fate of the ill-judged and ill-founded J.C.P.O.A., which Donald Trump killed on Tuesday by refusing to again waive sanctions on the Islamic Republic. He was absolutely right to do so ó assuming, that is, serious thought has been given to what comes next. In the weeks leading to Tuesdayís announcement, some of the same people who previously claimed the deal was the best we could possibly hope for suddenly became inventive in proposing means to fix it. This involved suggesting side deals between Washington and European capitals to impose stiffer penalties on Tehran for its continued testing of ballistic missiles ó more than 20 since the deal came into effect ó and its increasingly aggressive regional behavior. But the problem with this approach is that it only treats symptoms of a problem for which the J.C.P.O.A. is itself a major cause. The deal weakened U.N. prohibitions on Iranís testing of ballistic missiles, which cannot be reversed without Russian and Chinese consent. That wonít happen. The easing of sanctions also gave Tehran additional financial means with which to fund its depredations in Syria and its militant proxies in Yemen, Lebanon and elsewhere. Any effort to counter Iran on the ground in these places would mean fighting the very forces we are effectively feeding. Why not just stop the feeding? Apologists for the deal answer that the price is worth paying because Iran has put on hold much of its production of nuclear fuel for the next several years. Yet even now Iran is under looser nuclear strictures than South Korea, and would have been allowed to enrich as much material as it liked once the deal expired. Thatís nuts. Apologists also claim that, with Trumpís decision, Tehran will simply restart its enrichment activities on an industrial scale. Maybe it will, forcing a crisis that could end with U.S. or Israeli strikes on Iranís nuclear sites. But that would be stupid, something the regime emphatically isnít. More likely, it will take symbolic steps to restart enrichment, thereby implying a threat without making good on it. What the regime wants is a renegotiation, not a reckoning. Why? Even with the sanctions relief, the Iranian economy hangs by a thread: The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported ìhundreds of recent outbreaks of labor unrest in Iran, an indication of deepening discord over the nationís economic troubles.î This week, the rial hit a record low of 67,800 to the dollar; one member of the Iranian Parliament estimated $30 billion of capital outflows in recent months. Thatís real money for a country whose gross domestic product barely matches that of Boston. The regime might calculate that a strategy of confrontation with the West could whip up useful nationalist fervors. But it would have to tread carefully: Ordinary Iranians are already furious that their government has squandered the proceeds of the nuclear deal on propping up the Assad regime. The conditions that led to the so-called Green movement of 2009 are there once again. Nor will it help Iran if it tries to start a war with Israel and comes out badly bloodied. All this means the administration is in a strong position to negotiate a viable deal. But it missed an opportunity last month when it failed to deliver a crippling blow to Bashar al-Assad, Iranís puppet in Syria, for his use of chemical weapons. Trumpís appeals in his speech to the Iranian people also sounded hollow from a president who isnít exactly a tribune of liberalism and has disdained human rights as a tool of U.S. diplomacy. And the U.S. will need to mend fences with its European partners to pursue a coordinated diplomatic approach. The goal is to put Iranís rulers to a fundamental choice. They can opt to have a functioning economy, free of sanctions and open to investment, at the price of permanently, verifiably and irreversibly forgoing a nuclear option and abandoning their support for terrorists. Or they can pursue their nuclear ambitions at the cost of economic ruin and possible war. But they are no longer entitled to Barack Obamaís sweetheart deal of getting sanctions lifted first, retaining their nuclear options for later, and sponsoring terrorism throughout. Trumpís courageous decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal will clarify the stakes for Tehran. Now weíll see whether the administration is capable of following through."

The nuclear agreement does allow Iran to enrich uranium, but it limited enrichment capacity to less than one bombís worth for 15 years. Iran also gave up about 97 percent of its existing stockpile and two-thirds of its centrifuges. Under the deal, it can use no more than 5,060 first-generation centrifuges for a decade ó which The New York Timesís Max Fisher has described as ìso few, and such old models, and under constant monitoring, that it poses relatively little threat.î More advanced centrifuges were placed under monitored storage or can be used only for limited research purposes approved by the other signers of the deal. The deal also sought to prevent the possibility of a plutonium bomb by rendering an existing reactor inoperable and prohibiting the construction of other heavy-water reactors for 15 years. Tehran also pledged to never produce weapons-grade plutonium. Mr. Trump has made a version of this claim at least a dozen times since taking office, and he made it dozens of times while running for president. The nuclear deal released about $100 billion ó not $150 billion as he frequently claims ó in previously frozen Iranian assets. In other words, the money already belonged to Iran and did not come out of the pockets of American taxpayers, as some of Mr. Trumpís supporters have erroneously inferred from the presidentís claims. Much of the amount is also tied up in debt obligations, and estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion. And as The Times has previously reported, the cash payment Mr. Trump also mentioned refers to a separate matter: The Obama administration did transfer $1.7 billion to Iran, but Mr. Trumpís statement requires more context. The money ó delivered in cash, some on a plane ó was payment for a decades-long dispute and was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. Before the 1979 revolution, Iranís shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, they were never delivered. The clerics who seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years. An initial reimbursement was released after the Iran deal was implemented and to help secure the release of American hostages. ìBreakoutî refers to the time it would take Iran to produce enough fuel for one weapon, and the agreement increased that time to at least a year from an estimated two to three months. Since the deal limits Iranís enrichment capacity and stockpile to less than one bombís worth for 15 years, Iran would not be ìon the verge of a nuclear breakoutî until 2030. Itís also worth noting that the agreement prohibits Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons permanently. ìIran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons,î the first paragraph of the deal reads. The Iran deal was reached in June 2015, but went into effect in early 2016, when the United States and European nations lifted sanctions. Since then, Iranís military spending has increased by about 30 percent, from $10.8 billion in 2015 to $14.1 billion last year, adjusted for inflation, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that Iranís defense budget was about 3 percent of the gross domestic product, or $15 billion, in 2015 and about 4 percent of G.D.P., or $20 billion, in 2018. Mr. Trump is referring to documents shared by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel that Mr. Netanyahu said ìconclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons program.î As The Times has reported, much of what Mr. Netanyahu detailed was known before the diplomatic agreement was reached: ìBut the Iranian program to design and build nuclear weapons was hardly a secret; its existence was the reason that the United States, under President George W. Bush and then President Barack Obama, moved to block it. Both presidents said publicly that Iran had a bomb project underway, and the United States mounted, with Israel, a vast covert program to undermine the Iranian effort with one of the worldís most sophisticated cyberattacks.î American intelligence agencies said in a 2007 report that Iran had frozen its nuclear weapons program in 2003. International inspectors had published information on the program in 2011. Mr. Netanyahu did not provide evidence that Iran had violated the Iran deal itself."

Violating it will make the United States far less safe.,Susan E. Rice,Opinion,Domestic Politics,"Nuclear weapon, Politics, Embargoes Sanctions, US Foreign Policy, Arms control, Donald Trump, Iran","President Trumpís reckless decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal will not force Iran back to the negotiating table, nor will it address serious concerns about Iranís behavior in the Middle East. But it will leave Iranís nuclear program unconstrained, and an inconstant America isolated from its allies and far less safe. The Iran deal has worked as intended. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United States intelligence community, the United Nations Security Council and the presidentís top advisers, Iran has fully complied with its obligations. As required, Iran relinquished 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile, dismantled two-thirds of its centrifuges and its entire plutonium facility, abided by the most intrusive international inspection and monitoring regime in history, and forswore ever producing a nuclear weapon. This agreement was never about trust. It is about stringent verification ó in perpetuity. The deal effectively cut off all potential pathways for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. Now President Trump has ceded the moral high ground and freed Iran from all those constraints. Iran will be able to resume its nuclear activities without being blamed for violating the agreement. Instead, it is the United States that is about to unilaterally violate the very agreement it negotiated by reimposing nuclear-related sanctions while Iran remains in compliance. Mr. Trump disregarded the pleas of our closest European allies, who worked for months to try to address his objections. Instead of reaching agreement with our allies, President Trump told them to get lost and now will penalize European companies for abiding by an agreement that is working. The political and economic consequences for our relationship with Europe will most likely be considerable. The costs to American global leadership are steep. When the United States unilaterally abrogates an international agreement in the absence of any breach, we undermine international perceptions of our reliability and responsibility. That is precisely what we have already done with the Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But violating the Iran deal is far more dangerous. Iran could stay in the deal for now, if the remaining signatories can provide sufficient trade and investment benefits. Yet this outcome is far from assured and likely unsustainable, given the ability of the United States to impose painful sanctions against foreign entities doing business with Iran. Alternatively, Iran could resume its nuclear activities unfettered ó either gradually or rapidly ó and even withdraw from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, making it a far more dangerous actor in a volatile region. The nuclear deal was never intended, nor was it able, to address Iranís other pernicious behavior: its support for terrorism, malign influence in neighboring countries and ballistic missile program. But the deal always made good sense because Iranís nefarious activities would be far more dangerous if they were backed by a nuclear capability. By withdrawing from the deal, we have weakened our ability to address these other concerns. With Iran unconstrained, Saudi Arabia and others in the region may push to obtain a nuclear capacity. The hard-liners in Iran who never liked the nuclear deal will be strengthened in their bid to destabilize the region, leaving relative moderates like President Hassan Rouhani sidelined. In light of Americaís abrogation of its commitments, Russia and Chinaís position in the region will be bolstered at our expense. Israel may now rush into conflict with Iran, betting it can draw in the United States. Under any scenario, America will be less safe; and in the worst case, we could face the choice of going to war or acquiescing to a nuclear-armed Iran. President Trump, disdainful of any success of his predecessor, has long been determined to destroy this agreement, even though it has served American interests and won the grudging support of many of its original critics. The president spiked the Iran deal out of spite and hubris, with no viable alternative. He asserts that, with increased pressure on Iran, he can negotiate a better deal. But only someone who knows nothing about Iran would presume that it will pay more under duress to get the same thing it was promised three years earlier. If Mr. Trump thinks he is sending a strong message of resolve to North Korea, he is again mistaken. Instead, he is demonstrating to a far more advanced and unpredictable adversary on the eve of negotiations that the United States cannot be trusted. He has provided proximate proof that any deal the United States makes, even a successful one, may be tossed aside on the whim of this or any other president. Our negotiating partners, including Japan, South Korea and China, will doubt our credibility when we most need to demonstrate collective resolve. Why would Kim Jong-un give up his nuclear and missile capability when the United States has just demonstrated that, once he does so, it might well renege on the bargain? The president has just made the most foolish and consequential national security decision of his tenure. Exactly what comes next is unclear, but we certainly will face a far worse situation than today. When the mess materializes, Mr. Trump, per standard procedure, will blame everyone else: his political opponents, his predecessor, the Europeans and the Iranians. But there will be only one person responsible: President Trump, our wrecking ball in chief."

Hereís How Republicans, Democrats and the World Reacted.",World leaders and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle were quick to weigh in after President Trump announced his plan to withdraw the United States from the nuclear accord.,The New York Times,World,Domestic Politics,"US Foreign Policy, Nuclear weapon, Iran, Donald Trump","World leader and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle were quick to weigh in on Tuesday after President Trump announced his plan to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear accord. The following is a roundup of some of the reaction. For more coverage of Mr. Trumpís decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran deal, read our main story or the full transcript of Mr. Trumpís announcement. ìIt is with regret and concern that we, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, take note of President Trumpís decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Together, we emphasize our continuing commitment to the J.C.P.O.A. This agreement remains important for our shared security.î They added, ìWe urge the U.S. to ensure that the structures of the J.C.P.O.A. can remain intact, and to avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal. After engaging with the U.S. administration in a thorough manner over the past months, we call on the U.S. to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear nonproliferation brought about by the J.C.P.O.A., by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements. We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the U.S.; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, cooperating fully and in a timely manner with IAEA inspection requirements. The IAEA must be able to continue to carry out its long-term verification and monitoring program without restriction or hindrance. In turn, Iran should continue to receive the sanctions relief it is entitled to whilst it remains in compliance with the terms of the deal.î ìThe European Union regrets todayís statement by the president of the United States on the nuclear deal with Iran [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, J.C.P.O.A.]. Should the U.S. reconsider this position, we would welcome it. The United States remain our closest partner and friend, and we will continue to work together on many other issues. As we have always said, the nuclear deal is not a bilateral agreement and it is not in the hands of any single country to terminate it unilaterally.î She added, ìI am particularly worried by the announcement of new sanctions. I will consult with all our partners in the coming hours and days to assess their implications. The European Union is determined to act in accordance with its security interests and to protect its economic investments. The nuclear deal with Iran is the culmination of 12 years of diplomacy. It belongs to the entire international community. It has been working and it is delivering on its goal, which is guaranteeing that Iran doesnít develop nuclear weapons. The European Union is determined to preserve it. We expect the rest of the international community to continue to do its part to guarantee that it continues to be fully implemented, for the sake of our own collective security.î ìThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action represented a deeply flawed agreement, which President Trump has determined is not in the national security interests of the United States. Iranís malign behavior across the broader Middle East ó support to proxies such as Shia militias within Iraq, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen and militias inside of Syria, use of cyberattacks, support for terrorism and pursuit of an advanced ballistic missile program ó must all be addressed in a wider regional effort. Our European partners now have an opportunity to come back to the table with Secretary Pompeo and negotiate the best terms to create either a better agreement, or a maximum-pressure campaign against Iran. I share the objective and commitment made by the president that Iran should never be able to acquire or develop a nuclear weapon.î ìFrom the beginning, the Obama-era Iran deal was deeply flawed. Iranís hostile actions since its signing have only reaffirmed that it remains dedicated to sowing instability in the region. The presidentís announcement today is a strong statement that we can and must do better. I have always believe the best course of action is to fix the deficiencies in the agreement. It is unfortunate that we could not reach an understanding with our European partners on a way to do that, but I am grateful to them for working with the United States toward that goal. The president is right to insist that we hold Iran accountable both today and for the long-term. There will now be an implementation period for applying sanctions on Iran. During that time, it is my hope that the United States will continue to work with our allies to achieve consensus on addressing a range of destabilizing Iranian behavior ó both nuclear and non-nuclear.î ìI have no doubt that the J.C.P.O.A. was flawed and that for years Iran has been deceptive about its nuclear and other programs. My preference would have been to give our European allies a few more months to strengthen the deal, but now that the president has decided that the United States will withdraw, we must have two critical priorities. One is to further enhance our own military capabilities. The other is to strengthen our alliances. A strong, international effort is required to curtail Iranís aggressive behavior in a number of areas.î ìIím glad that President Trump decided today to withdraw from the flawed Iran nuclear deal and impose crippling economic and financial sanctions against the Iranian regime. This agreement was so bad that bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress voted against it after the last administration refused to submit it as a legally binding treaty under the Constitution.î He added, ìAfter Israelís recent revelations of Iranís secret archive of nuclear weaponization plans, the American people deserve better than a bad deal that paves the Iranian terror regimeís path to nuclear weapons. And the Iranian people deserve better as they continue to suffer under the regimeís criminal corruption, economic mismanagement, and systemwide human rights abuses.î ìThere are few issues more important to the security of the United States than the potential spread of nuclear weapons, or the potential for even more destructive war in the Middle East. Thatís why the United States negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J.C.P.O.A.) in the first place. The reality is clear. The J.C.P.O.A. is working ó that is a view shared by our European allies, independent experts and the current U.S. secretary of defense. The J.C.P.O.A. is in Americaís interest ó it has significantly rolled back Iranís nuclear program. And the J.C.P.O.A. is a model for what diplomacy can accomplish ó its inspections and verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to put in place with North Korea. Indeed, at a time when we are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from the J.C.P.O.A. risks losing a deal that accomplishes ó with Iran ó the very outcome that we are pursuing with the North Koreans. That is why todayís announcement is so misguided. Walking away from the J.C.P.O.A. turns our back on Americaís closest allies, and an agreement that our countryís leading diplomats, scientists and intelligence professionals negotiated. In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one administration to the next. But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding Americaís credibility, and puts us at odds with the worldís major powers.î ìThe presidentís refusal to waive certain sanctions on Iran sets in motion the dismantling of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has successfully prevented Iran from developing nuclear weapons. While the J.C.P.O.A. was far from perfect, by signing the agreement, Iran gave up 98 percent of its uranium stockpile, dismantled 2/3 of its centrifuges, rendered its heavy water nuclear reactor unusable and agreed to unprecedented inspections that provide critical insight into, and early warning about, any attempts by Iran to accelerate its nuclear program. Trump administration leaders, all parties to the agreement, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with its verification, have agreed that Iran has complied with its terms. Simply withdrawing the United States from the J.C.P.O.A. will not benefit the American people and U.S. national security: It will only succeed in driving a wedge between us and our allies, whose help we need to enforce any future sanctions regime against Iran, and will effectively green light Iranís pursuit of nuclear weapons. Withdrawing from this agreement makes the United States, and the world, less secure.î ìThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is a great diplomatic achievement. Experts and our allies all agree that this landmark agreement has been successful in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and even senior Trump Administration officials have confirmed that Iran has remained in compliance with the agreement. Yet, the president has chosen to utterly ignore that reality.î She added, ìThis rash decision isolates America, not Iran. Our allies will hold up their end of the agreement, but our government will lose its international credibility and the power of our voice at the table. The presidentís decision to abdicate American leadership during a critical moment in our effort to advance a denuclearization agreement with North Korea is particularly senseless, disturbing and dangerous. Democrats have no illusions about the Iranian regime. We remain strongly committed to stopping the advancement of Iranís ballistic missile program, its egregious human rights abuses, and its support of terrorism and other nefarious activities in the region.î"

East Lead With Win Over Red Sox,Giancarlo Stanton homered twice and Aaron Judge delivered good defense and a key R.B.I. as the Yankees won for the 16th time in 17 games.,Billy Witz,Sports,Sports,"Baseball, Red Sox, Yankees, Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Judge, Luis Severino","There were no spikes-up slides, no retributive fastballs in the back and no bench-clearing brawls when the Red Sox rolled into Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night. Instead of a cage match, there was a baseball game befitting the two best teams in baseball in the formative months of the season, as Giancarlo Stanton hit two solo home runs, Aaron Judge delivered early with his arm and late with his bat, and the Yankees came away with a 3-2 victory. The win was the 16th in 17 games for the Yankees and pulled them into a first-place tie with the Red Sox, the team they have been chasing since the first Sunday of the regular season. Judge gave the Yankees a 3-2 lead in the seventh when he delivered a bases-loaded single to left off reliever Joe Kelly, much to the delight of the a fully engaged crowd. Kelly, who entered after Heath Hembree had loaded the bases with one out earlier in the seventh, had become a heel to Yankees fans after he drilled Tyler Austin with a 98-mile-per-hour fastball last month ó a punishment that Kelly delivered after Austin clipped shortstop Brock Holt with his spikes on a slide earlier in the game. When a Boston reporter suggested to Red Sox designated hitter J.D. Martinez ó who was wearing a ìJoe Kelly Fight Clubî T-shirt before the game ó that Kelly might be the second most despised figure in New York behind the disgraced former attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman, Martinez did not disagree. ìIt should be exciting when he comes out of the bullpen,î Martinez said. Judge fouled Kellyís first pitch in the air just beyond the first-base dugout, but it drifted back far enough that Red Sox first baseman Hanley Ramirez had no play. Judge then took a fastball for a ball before grounding a slider into left. Neil Walker scored, but Gleyber Torres, trying to score from second, was thrown out at the plate ó as was Stanton an inning later. But three runs were enough for the Yankees, who throughout the last week have repeatedly made the right play at the right moment. Their winning rally on Tuesday started after Walkerís dribbler along the first-base line rolled barely foul. He followed with a double into the right-field corner. After Torres walked, Hembree was called for a balk and then walked Brett Gardner ahead of Judgeís single. Stanton, who led off the second and fourth innings with home runs that appeared to take advantage of the dimensions of Yankee Stadium, recorded his third multi-homer game of the season. The Yankeesí starter, Luis Severino, did not seem as invulnerable as he did in last weekís masterpiece in Houston, but he was not far from it. He allowed six hits, struck out 11 and for the second consecutive game did not walk a batter. Severinoís only clean inning came in the sixth when he sandwiched a pop out by Xander Bogaerts between two strikeouts. Judge helped Severinoís cause in the third when he retrieved Christian Vazquezís leadoff hit in the right field corner and calmly threw a one-hop strike to shortstop Didi Gregorius, whose glove was waiting for the ball ó and Vazquezís outstretched arms ó inches above the bag. Though Judge came to Severinoís aid, not all the Yankeesí defenders followed suit. Torres booted a routine grounder at second base by Ramirez in the first, and catcher Gary Sanchez could not get down to block a slider in the dirt that Eduardo Nunez swung at for a third strike to lead off the fifth inning. The ball skipped past Sanchez, leaving him with no chance to throw out Nunez before he reached first. The mistake seemed of little consequence when Severino fanned the next two batters, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Vasquez. But Mookie Betts followed by lining a 2-1 slider to center field for a base hit bringing to the plate Andrew Benintendi, who hit two homers off Severino in a game here last August and carried a .500 career average against him entering Tuesday. Benintendi took a 100 m.p.h. fastball off the edge of the plate to run the count full. He then looped a changeup into center field, scoring Nunez and sending Betts to third. Severino fell behind Ramirez by 3-0 before getting him to foul off a pair of changeups. Ramirez grounded the next pitch, a 99.7 m.p.h. fastball up the middle, but Torres was stationed right behind second base and easily threw him out. The Red Sox got even when Severino was out of the game. After Nunez reached on an infield hit when Austin could not scoop Gregoriusís one-hop throw to begin the seventh, Manager Aaron Boone turned to his bullpen. David Robertson struck out Bradley Jr. and retired Vazquez on a fly ball to center. But after Nunez stole second on a two-strike pitch, Betts lofted a liner down the left-field line that dropped in front of Gardner, who dived but could neither catch nor corral the ball, which bounced away from him for a triple. The score was tied at 2-2, but Robertson averted further damage by striking out Benintendi to escape and give Judge a chance to win it. Aroldis Chapman then worked the ninth, allowing one base runner on a hit-by-pitch before recording his eighth save of the season."

The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics By Adam Becker 370 pp. Basic Books. $32. Are atoms real? Of course they are. Everybody believes in atoms, even people who donít believe in evolution or climate change. If we didnít have atoms, how could we have atomic bombs? But you canít see an atom directly. And even though atoms were first conceived and named by ancient Greeks, it was not until the last century that they achieved the status of actual physical entities ó real as apples, real as the moon. The first proof of atoms came from 26-year-old Albert Einstein in 1905, the same year he proposed his theory of special relativity. Before that, the atom served as an increasingly useful hypothetical construct. At the same time, Einstein defined a new entity: a particle of light, the ìlight quantum,î now called the photon. Until then, everyone considered light to be a kind of wave. It didnít bother Einstein that no one could observe this new thing. ìIt is the theory which decides what we can observe,î he said. Which brings us to quantum theory. The physics of atoms and their ever-smaller constituents and cousins is, as Adam Becker reminds us more than once in his new book, ìWhat Is Real?,î ìthe most successful theory in all of science.î Its predictions are stunningly accurate, and its power to grasp the unseen ultramicroscopic world has brought us modern marvels. But there is a problem: Quantum theory is, in a profound way, weird. It defies our common-sense intuition about what things are and what they can do. ìFiguring out what quantum physics is saying about the world has been hard,î Becker says, and this understatement motivates his book, a thorough, illuminating exploration of the most consequential controversy raging in modern science. The debate over the nature of reality has been growing in intensity for more than a half-century; it generates conferences and symposiums and enough argumentation to fill entire journals. Before he died, Richard Feynman, who understood quantum theory as well as anyone, said, ìI still get nervous with it...I cannot define the real problem, therefore I suspect thereís no real problem, but Iím not sure thereís no real problem.î The problem is not with using the theory ó making calculations, applying it to engineering tasks ó but in understanding what it means. What does it tell us about the world? From one point of view, quantum physics is just a set of formalisms, a useful tool kit. Want to make better lasers or transistors or television sets? The Schrˆdinger equation is your friend. The trouble starts only when you step back and ask whether the entities implied by the equation can really exist. Then you encounter problems that can be described in several familiar ways: Wave-particle duality. Everything there is ó all matter and energy, all known forces ó behaves sometimes like waves, smooth and continuous, and sometimes like particles, rat-a-tat-tat. Electricity flows through wires, like a fluid, or flies through a vacuum as a volley of individual electrons. Can it be both things at once? The uncertainty principle. Werner Heisenberg famously discovered that when you measure the position (letís say) of an electron as precisely as you can, you find yourself more and more in the dark about its momentum. And vice versa. You can pin down one or the other but not both. The measurement problem. Most of quantum mechanics deals with probabilities rather than certainties. A particle has a probability of appearing in a certain place. An unstable atom has a probability of decaying at a certain instant. But when a physicist goes into the laboratory and performs an experiment, there is a definite outcome. The act of measurement ó observation, by someone or something ó becomes an inextricable part of the theory. The strange implication is that the reality of the quantum world remains amorphous or indefinite until scientists start measuring. Schrˆdingerís cat, as you may have heard, is in a terrifying limbo, neither alive nor dead, until someone opens the box to look. Indeed, Heisenberg said that quantum particles ìare not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts.î This is disturbing to philosophers as well as physicists. It led Einstein to say in 1952, ìThe theory reminds me a little of the system of delusions of an exceedingly intelligent paranoiac.î So quantum physics ó quite unlike any other realm of science ó has acquired its own metaphysics, a shadow discipline tagging along like the tail of a comet. You can think of it as an ìideological superstructureî (Heisenbergís phrase). This field is called quantum foundations, which is inadvertently ironic, because the point is that precisely where you would expect foundations you instead find quicksand. Competing approaches to quantum foundations are called ìinterpretations,î and nowadays there are many. The first and still possibly foremost of these is the so-called Copenhagen interpretation. ìCopenhagenî is shorthand for Niels Bohr, whose famous institute there served as unofficial world headquarters for quantum theory beginning in the 1920s. In a way, the Copenhagen is an anti-interpretation. ìIt is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is,î Bohr said. ìPhysics concerns what we can say about nature.î Nothing is definite in Bohrís quantum world until someone observes it. Physics can help us order experience but should not be expected to provide a complete picture of reality. The popular four-word summary of the Copenhagen interpretation is: ìShut up and calculate!î For much of the 20th century, when quantum physicists were making giant leaps in solid-state and high-energy physics, few of them bothered much about foundations. But the philosophical difficulties were always there, troubling those who cared to worry about them. Becker sides with the worriers. He leads us through an impressive account of the rise of competing interpretations, grounding them in the human stories, which are naturally messy and full of contingencies. He makes a convincing case that itís wrong to imagine the Copenhagen interpretation as a single official or even coherent statement. It is, he suggests, a ìstrange assemblage of claims.î An American physicist, David Bohm, devised a radical alternative at midcentury, visualizing ìpilot wavesî that guide every particle, an attempt to eliminate the wave-particle duality. For a long time, he was mainly lambasted or ignored, but variants of the Bohmian interpretation have supporters today. Other interpretations rely on ìhidden variablesî to account for quantities presumed to exist behind the curtain. Perhaps the most popular lately ó certainly the most talked about ó is the ìmany-worlds interpretationî: Every quantum event is a fork in the road, and one way to escape the difficulties is to imagine, mathematically speaking, that each fork creates a new universe. So in this view, Schrˆdingerís cat is alive and well in one universe while in another she goes to her doom. And we, too, should imagine countless versions of ourselves. Everything that can happen does happen, in one universe or another. ìThe universe is constantly splitting into a stupendous number of branches,î said the theorist Bryce DeWitt, ìevery quantum transition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote corner of the universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies of itself.î This is ridiculous, of course. ìA heavy load of metaphysical baggage,î John Wheeler called it. How could we ever prove or disprove such a theory? But if you think the many-worlds idea is easily dismissed, plenty of physicists will beg to differ. They will tell you that it could explain, for example, why quantum computers (which admittedly donít yet quite exist) could be so powerful: They would delegate the work to their alter egos in other universes. Is any of this real? At the risk of spoiling its suspense, I will tell you that this book does not propose a definite answer to its title question. You werenít counting on one, were you? The story is far from finished. When scientists search for meaning in quantum physics, they may be straying into a no-manís-land between philosophy and religion. But they canít help themselves. Theyíre only human. ìIf you were to watch me by day, you would see me sitting at my desk solving Schrˆdingerís equation...exactly like my colleagues,î says Sir Anthony Leggett, a Nobel Prize winner and pioneer in superfluidity. ìBut occasionally at night, when the full moon is bright, I do what in the physics community is the intellectual equivalent of turning into a werewolf: I question whether quantum mechanics is the complete and ultimate truth about the physical universe.î"

By the time you arrive in Breaux Bridge, population 8,139, two hours west of New Orleans, you will have adjusted to the dense, damp heart of Louisiana Cajun country. A few strip malls with dollar stores and fast-food restaurants have sprouted in recent years, but the town remains, like most of those along the bayou, stuck in the 1950s ó there are muddy roads punctuated by crawfish joints, churches and, every hundred yards or so, billboards hawking personal injury lawyers (ìHurt Again?î) or swamp tours. And then, through a thatch of 300-year-old giant live oaks dripping with Spanish moss, a vision stops you: an impossibly ornate, five-story square tower made of sand-finished concrete blocks, wood and pressed-iron sheeting ringed by topiary in 19th-century pots, surrounded by a four-foot-deep masonry-lined moat. You have arrived inside a Louis XV fever dream here on the banks of Lake Martin, the entirely self-created anachronistic empire of the antiques dealer Robert E. Smith, sixth-generation Louisianian, first-generation peerless eccentric. His voice rings out as you pull up; the perfect drawl, raised a bit to carry through the soupy air. He is 71, with a 17th-century Van Dyke beard and a silk ascot. ìI suggest you begin walking where the pea-gravel path starts in order to approach the tower from its best vantage point,î he says, pointing to a twisting route laid out amid the cypress and the spider lilies. It is perpetually 1750 here, give or take a decade or two. ìThere really isnít much use for the present,î Smith says, ushering you into a room with a crackling fire below a limestone mantel imported from Provence. The 66-foot-high tower, which sits on 13 acres, features one large room per floor, connected via a steep wooden spiral staircase that moves you from the ground-floor guest room to the entry-level dining area to the third-floor bedroom, up to the salon on the fourth floor and finally to the rooftop terrace, with its daybed dramatically shrouded in mosquito netting. Although the building is square, its rooms are octagonal, precisely 548 square feet each, with the mechanicals and bathrooms tucked behind the plaster and boiserie walls. Every item ó brocade sofas, velvet upholstered chairs, metal hinges, parquet de Versailles floors ó is period perfect; Smith will brook no interruption of his rococo illusion. His home was inspired by the ìgarden folliesî of the era he venerates, known in France as ìfabriques.î By definition, they were gloriously without purpose, outlandish in an otherwise groomed landscape. Fashioned as crumbling Roman temples, Turkish tents, ruined Gothic abbeys or vertiginously tall Asian pagodas, they provided both aesthetic charm and a clear satirical subtext: These were monuments to classical virtue in contrast to 18th-century court excess. Smith, the product of a ìvery regular football-and-TV householdî about 30 miles away, has lived in the region his entire life. In high school, he took a tour of a local house ìdone up in what they called French Provincial,î he says, and became transfixed by its 18th-century accouterments. After earning a degree in architecture at the University of Southwestern Louisiana in nearby Lafayette, he worked in a natural history museum, then began to travel back and forth to France to source container loads of antiques for a small roster of local clients. He now spends half the year in the South of France, trawling the countryside for Louis XV-era treasures. He owns a house in UzËs, near NÓmes, completely outfitted in period style. His main operation, though, is Au Vieux Paris Antiques, a shop in Breaux Bridge that he runs from a pair of weather-worn 19th-century homesteads a few miles from the folly. Smith lived in one of these for decades (ìthat one I did up in early Louisiana furniture and Directoire,î he says) until he finished his tower 18 years ago, after two years of nonstop construction. The first three contractors refused the job before he ìfound one crazy enough to take on my own particular craziness,î he says. Smith schooled the painters in a nine-step crackle finish to ensure the trim matched the ancient doors, and says the craftsmen ìwere so inspired by the project that they would go home and bathe after work and then just come back to sit here wordlessly.î Smith spends most evenings alone, watching VHS tapes on his í90s-era television, cleverly camouflaged behind a panel in the bedroom. He loves to throw dinner parties in his folly in the woods, though he concedes it isnít always easy to attract a ìproper rosterî of guests. When he does manage to get people together, he serves a full French Creole feast on his Comte díArtois porcelain and 19th-century crystal; for his birthday, a friend hired violinists to play from a clandestine loft that overlooks the living room. ìThere is a scrim up so they couldnít gaze at the guests while they played, of course,î Smith says. As for the wisdom of having people enjoy a jeroboam of B‚tard-Montrachet before negotiating a flight of vertiginous stairs to find a bathroom wedged behind a hidden door, he is suitably dismissive: ìPeople have been drinking large quantities of wine and descending steep steps for thousands of years, my dear. Some things simply should not be worried about.î"

It is a creature of frightening extremes, this being you once were: more hopeful and hopeless, joyous and despairing, loving and hateful than you have ever been since. Most likely, she or he is someone you try to avoid talking to. So let us give thanks that the insanely talented playwright Clare Barron feels no such reticence. Her glorious new work, ìDance Nation,î which opened on Tuesday evening at Playwrights Horizons, conjures the passionate ambivalence of early adolescence with such being-there sharpness and poignancy that youíre not sure whether to cringe, cry or roar with happiness. Part of you will definitely feel like staring at your shoes throughout much of this group portrait of a competitive dance team made up of middle-school girls. But when a play is as blazingly original and unsettlingly familiar as this one, youíre obliged to keep your eyes on the stage and marvel at how close what you see cuts to the bone ó your bone. You may be questioning my use of the word ìoriginal.î Stories about earnest students giving their all for the team have long been the basis for popular shows about cheerleaders (ìBring It Onî), balletomanes (ìCenter Stageî) and singers (ìGleeî), not to mention the infinite variations in the realm of sports. But like ìThe Wolves,î Sarah DeLappeís excellent debut play from 2016 about a girlsí soccer team, Ms. Barron is using an endlessly recycled formula to explore a time in life when minds and bodies are in a state of teeming flux. Itís an age when the bodyís center of gravity seems suddenly to be located, thrillingly and alarmingly, directly between the legs. ìPussy,î a word thrust abruptly into mainstream conversation during the 2016 presidential election, becomes the obsessive mantra for the girls in ìDance Nation.î It is spoken shyly, slyly, confrontationally and beatifically by a fearless cast, directed and choreographed with gloriously rough magic by Lee Sunday Evans. By the productionís end you are almost guaranteed to agree with the writer Lorrie Mooreís assertion ìI sometimes think of female adolescence as the most powerful life force that human nature has to offer.î This is where I tell you that none of the ìDance Nationî actresses, who offer such vivid confirmation of Ms. Mooreís theory, are anywhere near the age of 13. They range from their 20s to their 60s, yet I never doubted that they were bona fide adolescents. Their performances have no hint of condescension or preciousness. But thatís not to say that their interpretations are entirely naturalistic. With ìIíll Never Love Again,î Ms. Barronís extraordinary choral piece two years ago, in which her own anguished teenage diaries were recited (and sung) by a large and eclectic cast, she redefined the memory play. It was a work that expanded first-person experience into an all-reflecting hall of mirrors. In ìDance Nationî she creates a gallery of specifically detailed individuals who, however much they might long for it, can never meld completely with someone else, even their very best friends. But the fact that the actresses playing these girls are adults implicitly makes this latest work, too, a memory play ó and a reminder of how impossible it is to escape the way we were. The Liverpool, Ohio, team training for the nationals here is led by Dance Teacher Pat (a pricelessly serious Thomas Jay Ryan) and comprises six girls (played by Purva Bedi, Eboni Booth, Camila CanÛ-Flavi·, Ellen Maddow, Dina Shihabi and Lucy Taylor) and one boy (Ikechukwu Ufomadu). The star of the group is undeniably the innately graceful and laser-focused Amina (a perfectly cast Ms. Shihabi). But for their new competition entry, which is about the life and legacy of Gandhi, it is Aminaís best friend, Zuzu (a direct and intelligent Ms. Booth), who is chosen to be the lead dancer. Zuzu is as dance-mad as Amina is ó but not nearly as talented, which she well knows. This imbalance in casting creates an uneasiness that spreads through the team like a virus. That doesnít sound so different from the plot of a multiplex rooting flick, does it? The girls of ìDance Nationî have internalized the clichÈs of such showsí mythology, as has Dance Teacher Pat. (There is a witty, fleeting nod to ìA Chorus Lineî in the audition sequence.) The difference is that, this being a work of theater, Ms. Barron and Ms. Evans have full license to distort surface reality to show whatís happening within. Arnulfo Maldonadoís dance-studio set has room for the emergence of a surreal, fairy-tale moon and a curtain-windowed corridor, from which emerges the sound of fractious adults. (Christina Rouner plays a witty succession of moms.) When a semi-celebrity graduate of their program is mentioned, the girls hiss her name in sibilant wonder and envy. When they huddle and chant their teamís slogans, they sound as primal as starving cougars that have spotted new prey. While rehearsing the Gandhi number, they turn into full-fanged, erotically overcharged vampires. Every so often, soliloquies happen: out-of-time monologues in which the girls give voice to concealed narcissism and abysmal doubts. Ms. Taylorís paean to her characterís brilliance and beauty has a solar force that blinds, while Ms. Eboniís assessment of what makes a star ó and why Zuzu doesnít have it ó is heartbreaking in its pragmatism. Whether in the dressing room or backstage, the conversation is authentically piquant in its shifts between confidence and uncertainty as discussions pivot among topics including masturbation, life ambitions and how to lose oneís virginity. Despite the appealing, low-key presence of Mr. Ufomadu, boys are rarely the subject. These girls are focused with full-beam intensity on one another and the feelings of profound attachment and loneliness that emerge from being part of a team. Sometimes, a character will turn into the woman she will become, recalling what happened years before with a heightened clarity that real memory never allows. Ms. Maddow, a sexagenarian actress associated with the experimental troupe Talking Band, has one such moment that I canít get out of my head. I donít want to ruin it for you. But it involves a sense of transcendence ó of possessing uncanny and unexpected talents ó that is unique to teetering on the dangerous edge of adulthood. Such feelings are hard to retrieve years later. That is, unless you have the blessed, empathic omniscience of a godly, forgiving artist like Ms. Barron."
212,nytimes,https://www.nytimes.org/,2018:05:08,4:00:01,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/lens/bridging-the-gap-between-mothers-and-daughters-in-iran.html,Bridging the Gap Between Mothers and Daughters in Iran,"In her project ìThe Wall,î Mojgan Ghanbari sought to start a dialogue between Iranian mothers and daughters.",Sara Aridi,Lens,International,"Women and Girls, Parenting, Politics, Muslim Veiling, Photography, Iran","Mojgan Ghanbari was assigned in 2017 to submit a photo essay on borders to the Joop Swart Masterclass, a workshop for up-and-coming young photographers. She had been documenting the lives of young women in Iran, her home country, for a series titled ìZanan,î or ìwomenî in Persian. That project earned her a $10,000 grant from Getty Images and inspired her to explore another side of femininity: the relationship between mothers and daughters. ìI came to this realization that young women are influenced by their parents,î Ms. Ghanbari said. And yet, she added, ìI felt like there might be a border, there might be something like a wall we create at a certain age between ourselves and our parents.î That invisible barrier is a universal aspect of young adulthood, one that surfaces the moment we realize we inherit so much from our elders, yet lead completely different lives. For many young Iranian women today, that gap is widened by several factors, the most obvious being the Islamic Revolution. Her latest project, ìThe Wall,î explores that generational tension as it aims to answer two vital questions: ìHow does this gap influence our relationship with our mothers as the first feminine figures we see in life?î ìHow could we communicate better with each other?î ìI wanted to talk about generations but in an intimate, poetic way,î Ms. Ghanbari said, emphasizing that she aimed to highlight underlying similarities across cultures rather than apparent differences. Under the Pahlavi dynasty, which reigned from 1925 to 1979, women experienced relative freedom in the region: The hijab, the Islamic head scarf, was banned; the minimum age for marriage was raised; and unjust divorce laws were made slightly fairer. But the 1979 Islamic Revolution reversed decadesí worth of progress toward gender equality, imposing a political ideology that restrains women through discriminatory religious laws and limits their societal roles to mothers and housewives. As a result, many women today donít relate to some of their mothersí experiences growing up before the revolution. ìFor years I was so jealous of what my mom had in her young age,î Ms. Ghanbari, 28, said. While leafing through her motherís and grandmotherís photo albums, she yearned for experiences her generation never had: walking through the streets of Tehran in colorful skirts instead of compulsory veils; strolling along the Caspian Sea coast in bikinis. ìIt sounds surreal more than anything else,î Ms. Ghanbari said. She later came to think that those liberties comprised a ìkind-ofî freedom. ìPatriarchal power, sexism, was still there,î she said. Women may be required to wear hijabs under current laws, a restriction that was widely protested this year. But most of the civil code provisions enforced in Iran today were drafted years before the revolution. And compared with their mothers, todayís women are far more educated. The female literacy rate climbed from 35 percent in 1977 to 80 percent in 2006, according to a report by the Iranian newspaper Donya-e-Eqtesad. And women now make up the majority of test takers in the national university entrance exams. Combined with the changes brought by globalization and the digital age, Ms. Ghanbari says those positive steps have inspired young women to seek more opportunities than their mothers could have. But they have also created barriers between the generations. Ms. Ghanbari says she has seen many young Iranian women keeping things from their mothers not out of fear of retribution, but out of fear of misunderstanding or judgment. She set out to examine, and possibly bridge, that gap with ìThe Wall,î a series of mother-daughter portraits, photos from family albums and detail shots capturing her subjectsí daily lives. She wanted her subjects to feel comfortable sharing personal details, both with her and each other. ìI spent a couple of weeks with some of them,î she said. ìIt helped us bond more and they opened up about their dreams, memories of their young age. It was like a journey through history.î She concluded that mother-daughter relationships in traditional societies the world over are most affected by the values the women do or donít share. Those differences ìcreate a wall between them,î Ms. Ghanbari said. But, she added, ìI donít think that wall is going to be there forever.î All women have to do is let each other in.

Hereís how to find reputable movers and get everything to your new home safely.",Ayn-Monique Klahre,Smarter Living,Lifestyle,"Moving company, Relocation, Real Estate and Housing","Each year, about 3 million people in the U.S. move across state lines. While moving is never easy, the company you hire can make that transition smooth ó or a nightmare. Last year, the National Consumer Complaint Database received more than 4,000 complaints from consumers for everything from a delayed delivery to having their goods held hostage by their movers. So, if youíre planning to move across the country (or even just across a bridge to a new state), take these steps to hire movers who can do the job, get your belongings there safely ó and not rip you off in the process. Start your search as soon as you know youíll be moving. Ideally you can book your shippers at least 30 days in advance, while some companies will let you do it as early as 90 days ahead of time. Your first line of defense is to ask around for recommendations from friends, family and colleagues. If you donít know anyone who has moved recently, skip the Google search (itís easy for bad actors to pull together a reputable-looking site) and look up house movers on the Better Business Bureau site, where theyíre rated on a number of factors, including complaints and legal action against the company. You can also check out reviews on Yelp, but as always, take those with a gain of salt. As you start your search, get familiar with the terms youíll hear from moving companies ó for many, itís an all-new vocabulary, including phrases like the bill of lading, which is the receipt for your goods and contract for their transportation. Once you have a list of recommendations, look deeper into each one. You will need the companyís name, its U.S. Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) number and its Motor Carrier (M.C.) number. If theyíre missing either number, cross them off the list ó it means theyíre not licensed to move property across state lines. Search the company using their M.C. number or D.O.T. number at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrationís website. The results will show you whether the company is a carrier, broker or freight forwarder. A carrier is a company that you hire directly to move your goods, while a broker will hire a carrier for you, usually for a fee. A freight forwarder takes responsibility for your goods, but will use one or more carriers to move them, sometimes consolidating smaller moves into one larger truckload. Beyond understanding what kind of company youíre using, the safety administration website will give you the companyís most recent safety rating and insurance data, as well as the number and type of complaints that have been filed against the company in recent years. There are 14 different complaint categories, including loss and damage, weight disputes and holding goods hostage. While itís common for a company to have a few complaints, beware of numerous complaints about delays in delivery and repeated loss and damage claims. Call three to five companies for estimates. A reputable company will send a representative to do an on-site inspection. Anecdotally, Iíve found that itís hard to get in-person estimates for small moves, like one out of an apartment, so be prepared to call a few more places. Ideally, an in-person estimate will give you a clear idea of how much it will cost to move your things, rather than a vague one based on your number of bedrooms. When your shipping agent arrives, they are legally obligated to hand you a flyer called Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move. Then itís up to you to show them absolutely everything in your home to get the most accurate estimate possible. That includes all the junk stashed under the bed and items outside of your home, like bikes, strollers, garden equipment, and boxes in a basement or off-site storage. As you go through your home, flag items of extraordinary value, like artwork or antiques, that should be handled differently or insured at a higher rate. Many movers recommend you personally transport items of high personal value, like medical files, photo albums or car keys. And be aware that the mover will not transport hazardous or perishable items, including plants, pantry goods, cleaning supplies and alcohol; they should supply you with a detailed list. Youíll want to use these up, donate them or transport them yourself. While the agent is taking inventory of your belongings, ask how the estimate will be calculated. Also ask: Are there any base fees, will the total fee be calculated by weight, volume or time, and what do they charge for additional services like packing, transporting your goods up or down stairs, or moving heavy items like appliances or a piano? Find out if the moving company will have their own movers do the packing and driving, or whether they will subcontract to someone else, and whether your things will have to share a truck with other households. Find out whether you will be a ìdirectî move, where the same crew loads and unloads your belongings, or an ìindirectî one, where your things may switch trucks and moving crews before getting to your new home. The agent should also explain how your goods can be insured. Released value protection is the minimum standard, which recoups up to 60 cents per pound if something is lost or damaged. Some companies also offer full value protection for an additional fee. Be sure to read the fine print on this insurance to note any exclusions and what the shipperís idea of ìreplacementî is ó they might repair a damaged item, replace it with a like item, or give you cash to replace it. Separately, look into your own insurance to see if youíre covered by your renterís or homeownerís insurance, and compare that cost to the moversí coverage. After the inspection, you will receive a written estimate, which can be binding or nonbinding. A binding estimate means that they cannot charge more or less than the stated amount, unless the mover determines at the time of pickup that there are more items or services than originally estimated. (If this is the case, the movers would revise the estimate on-site for you to sign before packing up). A nonbinding estimate is typically based on weight, and they can charge up to 10 percent more once they get the official weight on your goods after packing them into the vehicle and stopping at a weigh station. You can ask to be present when they weigh the goods. When comparing estimates, price is the most obvious factor, but take the time to revisit the complaint database to determine which company has a history of better service. As with many things like this, you may not always want to go with the cheapest option. All things being equal, go with your gut or a friend or partnerís recommendation. Once youíve accepted an estimate, youíll receive an order for service, which will have all the carrier and pickup/drop-off information, as well as terms for payment, insurance and delivery dates. Do not sign any blank or incomplete documents. As you approach the pickup date, check in with your carrier to confirm the details or make any adjustments in writing. Pack up any items you will be moving yourself, as well as everything youíll need to live in your new space for up to two weeks before the rest of your household goods arrive. Plan to supervise the entire pickup, which could take one or more days, and plan to do the same for drop-off. On moving day, you will be handed a bill of lading as well as an inventory list; read them thoroughly before signing and hold on to them to compare at delivery.

She was stillborn in 2010, but her twin, Mikey, now 7, survived. ìPeople say, ëThatís kind of sad,í but I can say, ëIím a proud mom of four. Here I am with all of them,íî Ms. Nelson, 39, said of the photos of her and the kids gathered on the grass by Emilyís stone plaque. A Bloomington, Ill., kindergarten teacher, she is a member of an unofficial sorority of women who experienced acute grief while postpartum. The grief of fathers, adoptive mothers and other relatives after a family death is no less real, but postpartum women in mourning endure a particularly complicated blend of physical and emotional duress. First, there are factors that can affect any new mother: the physical discomfort of childbirth, the lack of sleep and anxiety about the baby. After giving birth, a new mother experiences rapid drops in levels of estrogen and progesterone and steep increases in prolactin. This can result in strong feelings of fatigue, irritability, insomnia and sadness known as the baby blues, which the National Institute of Mental Health says affects up to 80 percent of women. This is not the same as the more intense, ongoing postpartum depression, which doesnít reveal itself immediately, says Christiane Manzella, a senior psychologist who specializes in bereavement at the Seleni Institute, a womenís counseling center in New York. Grief disrupts the body in different ways, with effects that can include a weakened immune system, a perilous situation for a new mother. ìI was a mess, to put it in a nutshell,î said Gayle Brandeis, 50, a Nevada writer whose mother committed suicide in 2009, days after Ms. Brandeis gave birth to a son. She experienced bouts of dizziness and had difficulty catching her breath. ìI was really worried that my milk would dry out. I had a lot of stitches and walking was very painful,î she said. ìI felt so disoriented in my body.î Bereaved new mothers need people to remind them that there are no wrong feelings. ìIt feels incredibly isolating because youíre supposed to be happy,î said a Boston-area 47-year-old mother of two who works in marketing and asked to be identified only by her first name, Susan. In 2012, when Susan was on bed rest with a high-risk pregnancy while living overseas, her mother died unexpectedly. She could not travel for the funeral and was able to attend only via Skype. When Susan eventually gave birth to a daughter, her relationship to her baby was not what she expected. Her daughter had acid reflux, screamed a lot and slept little. ìI thought there would be this bond that I wouldnít want to break because she was somehow my mom incarnate. It wasnít that at all.î Throughout this experience, Susan, like most grieving new mothers, wondered, ìIs this normal?î Pediatricians are on the front lines of spotting signs of postpartum depression in new mothers, since they see babies and mothers sooner and more frequently than obstetricians. Dr. Dafna Ahdoot, a Los Angeles pediatrician, has helped grieving new mothers who were anxious about their surviving babyís health, concerned over whether they could take their newborn to an out-of-town funeral, or worried that their grief would negatively affect the baby. She advises grieving new mothers to prioritize their own eating and sleeping by securing help with night feedings and switching to formula feeding as needed if breast-feeding is too difficult. Many therapists specialize in postpartum depression or grief and can address both. ìItís so hard to tease those symptoms apart,î says Juli Fraga, a San Francisco psychologist who specializes in postpartum depression. A woman may think: ìëWhy wouldnít I be crying? Iím not sleeping.íî She helps her patients try meditation or breathing exercises to reduce levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, and then discuss, as needed, next steps like seeing a psychiatrist or integrative medical options. Not all women have access to or even desire professional support. With initiatives like Therapy for Black Girls, the mental health community is working to build a bridge to African-American women who may mistrust medical institutions. ìAfrican-American women are at higher risk for premature birth, and so we are losing our babies,î says Keisha Wells, a counselor in Columbus, Ga. ìIf youíre dealing with that and you donít have anybody to talk to and youíre a person of color, thatís added sorrow.î Ms. Wells did not have access to this type of mental health care 11 years ago when her twin sons, born prematurely, both died. But she said she found comfort in faith-based support. In the first weeks after a birth paired with a death, close loved ones can lighten a new motherís load by making thoughtful executive decisions. Ms. Nelsonís twinsí room was painted half pink and half blue, and set up with two cribs. Friends repainted it and removed Emilyís crib. ìNobody asked,î Ms. Nelson said. ìI didnít know if I wanted to be asked. It had to happen, and friends and family had to take care of it.î More than anything, most grieving new mothers need to express their grief. After Ms. Nelson took Mikey home, a friend brought over a picnic dinner. ìShe put the basket on the counter, took both my hands in her hands and said ëTell me about Emily,íî Ms. Nelson recalled. She said she appreciated that opportunity. Other well-intentioned people misunderstood and said, ìI didnít mean to make you sad,î when sheíd start to cry. She said she wanted to tell them: ìEmilyís death makes me sad. You talking about her makes me hope-filled, it makes me proud. The tears are going to come, but let me do that.î Many grieving mothers find solace in the stories of others, be they in books, online or in groups. Ms. Nelson was intrigued by the show ìThis Is Us,î in which the main characters lose one of their triplets at birth and impulsively decide to adopt an abandoned baby. ìThe first episode made me angry that they were like, ëWeíll just take this baby home instead,í but when they later showed the raw emotions that she had, I was a little more on board,î Ms. Nelson said. Mourning new mothers eventually find a way to honor both their lost loved one and their child using what is known as a continuing bond grief paradigm. Dr. Manzella said that it can be compatible with the ongoing waves of grief many mothers who have gone through loss experience, and that the thinking about grief has evolved from the ìaccept and let goî ideas in the classic ìfive stages of griefî model of the Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth K¸bler-Ross. ìWhy not continue loving in absence and getting solace from the sense of love?î she said. Sometimes, finding a way to mark the loss can help. Each year, Ms. Nelson and her family honor Emilyís birthday a day before Mikeyís, since her heart stopped beating the day before he was born. ìI have my day to be sad,î Ms. Nelson says. ìWe go to the cemetery with balloons. The kids are fully involved. Then the next day is all about Mikey.î"

So I was surprised that, when I mentioned a recent novel I liked, my new friend responded with head-shaking resignation. ìI canít see how anyone justifies talking about books anymore,î she said. Our nation was so overwhelmed with causes demanding attention and action, she suggested, that it had entered a state of constant emergency, whereby pursuits both personal and political must be pitted against one another to determine which are essential. A turn toward socially conscious criticism, ushered in by the internetís amplification of previously ignored perspectives, has meant that culture now tends to be evaluated as much for its politics as for its aesthetic successes (or failures). Certain works ó usually those that highlight the experiences of marginalized groups, or express some message or moral about the dangers of prejudice ó have been elevated in stature. Itís an overdue correction that brings with it an imposition: No longer just illuminating, instructive, provocative or a way to waste a few hours on a Saturday, these works have become ìnecessary.î The word is a discursive crutch for describing a workís right-minded views, and praise that is so distinct from aesthetics it can be affixed to just about anything, from two-dimensional romantic comedies to a good portion of the forthcoming books stacked beside my desk. Necessary for what is always left to the imagination ó the continuation of civilization, maybe. The disproportion of the descriptor is made clear when itís invoked to transform two very long, idiosyncratic theater productions into compulsory interventions in the issues they reflect: The New Yorkerís Hilton Als called the revival of Tony Kushnerís eight-hour play ìAngels in Americaî ìbrilliant, maddening and necessaryî; The Los Angeles Timesís Mark Swed made a similar pronouncement about Taylor Macís 24-hour queer history of popular music, which is typically performed in four six-hour shows without intermission. But if you skipped the second season of HBOís series ìDivorce,î about the dissolution of a marriage between two white, wealthy people, youíre safe. ì ëDivorceí is heartbreaking,î Rachel Syme wrote for The New Republic. But ìnow, when so much is at stake, even a glint of sunshine on this narrativeî cannot make the show ìfeel completely necessary.î What has become truly necessary is stating the obvious: No work of art, no matter how incisive, beautiful, uncomfortable or representative, needs to exist. Yet the internet ó the same force that has increased awareness of social-justice movements ó has hyperbolized all entreaties to our fragmented attention spans. Itís now as easy to see all the incredible and twisted ways the world causes suffering as it is to waste a couple hours scrolling through Twitter. The concerned citizenís natural response is to prioritize. Itís why so many outlets seem to invoke moral outrage as a growth strategy ó and why being told what you need to read or watch starts to be appealing. The prospect of ìnecessaryî art allows members of the audience to free themselves from having to make choices while offering the critic a nifty shorthand to convey the significance of her task, which may itself be one day condemned as dispensable. The effect is something like an absurd and endless syllabus, constantly updating to remind you of ways you might flunk as a moral being. Itís a slightly subtler version of the 2016 marketing tagline for the first late-night satirical news show with a female host, ìFull Frontal With Samantha Beeî: ìWatch or youíre sexist.î This usage seems to gesture everywhere but at the art itself, both as an admonishment to the audience and an indictment of the world that has begotten the themes contained in the work being discussed. If the point of art might once have been found in its pointlessness, this attempt to infuse it with purpose runs the risk of rendering it even more irrelevant. On the bright side, weíd have less homework. The relationship between art and politics has always been fraught. During the French Revolution, the German poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller observed that ìutility is the great idol of the time,î and he proposed that art, with its ability to expand the mind, could be a route to meaningful freedom. Later critics seized on the ideaís lurking elitism. The revolution eventually led to Napoleon, and from the fallout, which included the formation of a middle class with a taste for uncomplicated art and the money to pay for it, rose the bohemian movement in favor of ìart for artís sakeî ó and against the demand for meaning or morality in culture. The purpose ó or lack thereof ó of art will most likely be debated until the moment true liberation arrives, so a to-and-fro process repeats throughout history, with culture occasionally called upon to serve in ideological battle, then permitted to roam free. In the late 19th century, social-realist works depicting the working class and the poor proliferated in Europe, reaching their peak in America during the Great Depression. But by the 1940s and í50s, abstract expressionism emphasized pure form and feeling; art was, as Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko put it in a letter to the art editor of The Times: ìan adventure into an unknown world. ... The imagination is fancy-free and violently opposed to common sense.î The pendulum swung back quickly with the antiwar music of the Vietnam era and the social movements of the í70s. Art is infinitely adaptable; it accommodates activism naturally. When used to describe specific works today, however, ìnecessaryî constrains more than it celebrates. If we can access only the essential, we may start to crave the extraneous ó which, through this increasingly distracting yearning, may feel essential, too. Next to stories of grave injustice, the movie ìPaddington 2,î about a bear that wears a red hat, is still considered an ìan inviting, necessary bit of escapismî by Vanity Fair. The suggestion that leisure is crucial calls to mind the concept of ìself-care,î which has in recent years transcended its niche popularity among Tumblr users ó who are fond of a 1988 quote by the black lesbian writer Audre Lorde: ìCaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfareî ó to ride into the mainstream on this rationale. Now you can reframe any innocuous pleasant activity as a requisite component of your political practice. Companies and Instagram influencers have quickly manipulated the term to sell more stuff, and guilty individuals have found an easy way to account for their weekly manicures, or the afternoons they spend reading novels. Never mind that no one asked. An art museum is not a nail salon, but codifying an exhibition, novel or film as ìnecessaryî is a similar camouflaging maneuver that saddles an aesthetic pursuit with moral weight. Often it is burdensome to the audience, the work and the artist alike. When New York magazineís Matt Zoller Seitz calls the mini-series ìWacoî ìnecessary and sometimes powerful,î he separates the workís role from its ability to stir emotion, and in turn protects the show from any qualitative assessment. In a short review of Mohsin Hamidís ìExit West,î which tells the story of two refugees fleeing an unnamed country during a civil war, for the annual ìTournament of Booksî published by The Morning News, Patrick Hoffman calls the novel ìa full-fledged masterpiece; itís necessary, timely, wise and beautiful,î and in doing so, makes it seem as if ìnecessaryî is a precondition to ìmasterpieceî ó which in turn is downgraded, through the urgency of necessity, to second-string praise. Along with obligation and requirement, ìnecessaryî can also suggest inevitability, even predestination, the sense that a work is both mandatory for the audienceís political education and a foregone response to the world as it is. There are many noncomprehensive adjectives we can apply to good art: moving, clever, joyous, sad, innovative, boring, political. But good art doesnít have to be any of these things, necessarily; what we want out of it is possibility. To call a work ìnecessaryî keeps the audience from that possibility and saps the artist of autonomy as well. That itís frequently bestowed on artists from marginalized backgrounds pressures these artists to make work that represents those backgrounds. Worse, it subtly frames their output as an inevitability, something that would have happened regardless of creative agency, and thus suggests that these artists are less in control of their decisions and skills than their unnecessary counterparts. When applied to bad art with good politics, ìnecessaryî allows the audience to avoid engaging with a work in aesthetic terms, which tend to be more ambiguous and difficult. When applied to good art with good, or even ambivalent, politics, it renders aesthetic achievement irrelevant. Not only is that depressing, it also nullifies the political argument in favor of art in the first place: Why write a novel when a manifesto will do?"
